1,"Synopsis: The film invests significant time in world-building but falls short of captivating the audience within its narrative.First half: The initial segment is rather mediocre. While the Interval block attempts to instill excitement, the audience struggles to connect with the story from the outset. The buildup feels somewhat excessive.Second half: Exhaustive. A substantial twist at the end sets the stage for part 2, but its impact is diminished by a desire for the film to conclude. The prolonged buildup doesn't adequately match the actual scenes, resulting in a sense of loud anticipation that one wishes to end. Trimming 30 minutes from the 3-hour runtime would have made it a more engaging watch.Background music is subpar, excessively loud, creating an unwanted auditory experience. The songs merely exist without evoking much interest.Final verdict: ""Salaar"" is a film worth exploring when time permits. It has its moments of attraction, but overall, it delivers a rather lackluster cinematic journey.",Neutral
2,"Salaar has been my most-awaited film for 2023. It ticks most of the boxes for the mass movie fan in me: A mass movie focused on a single character dominance, Neel directorial which is usually a no-nonsense action movie with cracking goosebump scenes and a much awaited comeback for Prabhas who is tailor made for characters like this amongst other things. Salaar somehow touches most of these boxes but does not check it wholeheartedly.I will approach this review differently by describing how different aspects of the movie works but falls short somehow:The Plot/Story:
This is definitely the most complex storyline of a Prashant Neel movie. While the plot gets really interesting towards the end, you tend to realize that a lot of time was wasted in the first half for no good reason. Eventually the movie leaves a lot to be explored in Part 2 but I feel there could be too much left to show in Part 2 and I'm afraid there is going to be a tough job for editors. It is also quite a risky move to have not even planned to shoot Part-2 yet (which Neel has admitted in interviews) with so much left to be told.The Action:
Finally Prabhas gets his groove back with the action sequences which perfectly suit his body language. There are some great creative choices on some of the action scenes which are definitely bound to get cheers in the cinema halls although they aren't entirely logical. There are creative killings which justify the A rating but they were definitely not necessary for the plot, not that I'm complaining. But I would have definitely loved to see some more physical effort from the lead characters for some of the action scenes. At times it is just too cool and too easy.Screenplay:
Prashant Neel's strength has been screenplay over the storyline in his past movies but in Salaar it is the other way around. The movie does follow the traditional way of telling flashback stories like most mass movies but as the movie gets close to the end, there is no payback to the flashback narration. The movie ends like an interval scene which we have seen in most of the mass movies. This ending makes the first half screenplay seem pretty odd.Dialogues:
Neel's previous works have always boasted of minimal but impactful dialogues. While Uggram had some of the best written Kannada lines, KGF had very quirky and mass one liners especially with a good mix of Hindi. There aren't any trademark dialogues in Salaar which will etch in one's memory but Prabhas and Prithwiraj's does have some fun one liner exchanges. Those also serve as the little humour element in this movie. Dialogues are well written but it is not something you'd remember it for years to come.Music and Background Score:
Most of us were already slightly disappointed with the background score of Ravi Basrur in KGF 2 as compared to KGF 1. Unfortunately the background score doesn't really match up to Prabhas' screen presence and build up for most parts in the first half, especially for his introduction sequence. The music and background score does get better in the second half and there's a 'main theme music' which could have been made better use of in the first half as well. Overall, the background score falls short of creating some major goosebump moments leading up to the fight.Cinematography, Editing and Visuals:
Bhuvan Gowda continues his stellar form with some great shots and he manages to showcase Prabhas at his best. Aerial shots and shots of the city landscape totally reminds you of KGF 2 in many parts but not in a bad way. The visual effects team have done a great job in showcasing completely imaginary cities, towns and walls. The choice of using Neel's favourite dark-tone does seem excessive at times. Dare I say that they also have done a good job in digitally modifying Prabhas' looks in some scenes, and yes it is evident. While the action sequences are edited well, the same cannot be said about the shifts that we experience in some of the dramatic sequences. While the set design of Khansaar kingdom does remind you of many hollywood movies, the hair and make-up department has done an exceptional job in making each character stand out.Performances:
Neel manages to explore Prabhas' strengths perfectly by writing a role which involves him being the quiet and dangerous hero. Prabhas' performance does remind one of his Chatrapathi and other mass movie days without the unnecessary comedy and duet numbers. This is definitely the much needed comeback for Prabhas. Prithwiraj does excel as Varada Raja Mannar but at least for Part 1 there isn't any USP element for his role which makes him stand out or explore his strengths. Apart from these two, there is a plethora of supporting characters of which most of them have done nothing but justice to their role. Sriya Reddy, Bobby Simha, Garuda Ram, Madhu Guruswamy, Pramod Panju and Tinu Anand are some of the highlight performers. Of course special mention to Naveen Shankar who even with a very little screen presence makes a major impact and I am quite excited to see him in part-2. Just like the other Neel movies, we do have some creative choices for character and family names.Uggram Connection (Extra):
A lot has been discussed about this movie being a remake of Uggram, but let me assure you it's not. However Neel has straight up taken some scenes and moments from Uggram and recreated them here. He does have the creative freedom to do that considering its his own work but I personally feel that he should have admitted that to the Kannada audience. I could here some gasps of disappointment in the theatres for some of the exact scenes.Overall, Salaar makes for an almost satisfying theatrical experience but it leaves a lot of things open-ended. While it does deliver on the promise of a violent action film, it somehow fails to connect much at an emotional level. Neel continues to show how good he is at doing what he does but I feel that he does not really justify the time he has invested to bring this dinosaur finally out of its hideout.",Positive
3,"This time Prashanth's magic didn't worked out. As KGF holds up to Prashanths narration style plus Yash acting levels, Salaar has lot of dependency only on Prabhas(REBEL STAR). Story wasn't quiet interesting but elevations about second part in the movie gets the attention. Children singing song+seeking help from God+then Hero fight scenes are completely outdated. If this kind of screenplay continues its no more mass instead it makes us bore and looks like a comic. Please don't do this Mr. Neel garu.Just Prabhas makes the run time looks OK.Prabhas entry to KHANSAR: 🔥bgm remind me something like i am watching a MARVEL hero.For me personally the mother character role Eshwari garu performed little over-acting.Though the movie stood like a feast for mass fanzzz still it doesn't has much potential as expected. When i first watched kgf-1 i didn't liked it because of over hype back voice twlling about Yash but it was ok since it's all about introduction to Hero character likewise i hv satisfaction level about S🔥L🔥🔥R part 1.",Neutral

5,"Full of action and storylines.If you like action movie then you definitely gonna love this movie.Thrill and goosebumps in every action entry of prabhas. The violent prabhas is back on track.Action scenes are too good. Every character has done great job. Shruti Hassan's work is good but not too good.Next level of friendship has been shown. Prithviraj is too good, all the negative character roles has been done quite differently. It is not related to kgf but it gives kgf vibes also. I hope its part two will have much more than thisIt contains violence violence.If you want to see a drama, action, and if you want suspense, thriller then you must see this movie.",Positive
6,"There is no reason or point to watch the first half. Movie can directly start from the 2nd half.The pace of the film rises too fast in the 2nd half. This literally creates confusion in plot.The direction and BGM is far better in KGF.Being a pan-India and a broad film, the director must spend some time on VFX works. The VFX is too poor in some sequences, which will not make a quality film. Actors did a great work, the presence of PRABHAS filled the theatres.A commercial film.I am really waiting for the drama in khansar. The entire drama will be similar to GoT.The overall verdict - Watch it to watch SALAAR 2.",Positive

8,"Neon-drenched action and pulsating music ignite Prashanth Neel's Salaar, but beneath the dazzling surface lies a narrative wasteland. While fleeting moments of potential flicker in supporting performances, the film ultimately stumbles under the weight of its own bombast, failing to connect with audiences on an emotional level.Neel's penchant for spectacle over substance permeates the film. Thundering soundtracks and flamboyant set pieces mask a predictable plot built on overused tropes like ""friends turned enemies."" The narrative, echoing Neel's previous work, feels reheated and lacks the thematic depth and emotional resonance that captivated audiences in KGF.Prabhas, burdened by a stoic script, becomes a passive observer in his own film. His slow-motion walks and unemotional delivery fail to inject depth into the protagonist, leaving viewers struggling to connect with him or his motivations. The supporting cast, however, fares better. Prithviraj and Shriya Reddy deliver nuanced performances, hinting at the complexities their characters could have possessed had the script delved deeper.Action sequences, despite their visual flair, remain emotionally hollow. They roar with bombast but lack the raw power and thematic weight that fueled the fights in KGF. Neel throws spectacle at the screen, but it's like empty confetti - flashy and fleeting, leaving nothing behind but a sense of disappointment.Salaar's greatest sin lies not in its flaws, but in its missed potential. Glimpses of a compelling story, exploring complex relationships and emotional turmoil, flicker briefly before being extinguished by the film's relentless pursuit of spectacle. These fleeting moments serve as a painful reminder of what Salaar could have been, a film that resonated with audiences on a deeper level than mere visual thrills.Ultimately, Salaar is a disappointing detour for Neel.It descends from the raw power of KGF into a hollow spectacle, devoid of the emotional core and thematic depth that made his previous work so impactful. While sparks of potential glimmer in the supporting performances, they're not enough to salvage the overall underwhelming experience. Skip Salaar and revisit KGF for a more fulfilling encounter with Neel's directorial talent.",Positive
9,"The movie is a disappointing example of Telugu cinema's lack of originality. The first half of the movie has no clear story line and confuses the audience. It feels like random video clips are stitched together and the audience has to fill in the gaps. Some parts are so dragged out that the audience loses interest in the point. The second half of the movie is a poor imitation of Game of Thrones, with exaggerated characters and unnecessary violence. Shruthi Hasan's role is irrelevant and perplexing. The movie tries to copy the storyline where the Targaryen children are killed, but with Prabhas' tribe instead. Ultimately I was completely able to relate Prabas to John snow. The directors have wasted a huge budget on a movie that lacks creativity and coherence.",Negative
10,"Great Drama and acting. The first part has that punch that the audience is looking for, and 2nd half is full of drama and action with great storytelling in the background. Characters are clearly defined, and imagination to create the film needs to be greatly appreciated. Dev and vardha are incredible, especially their humor during the action sequence and they carry forward their friendship is the big highlight to the movie. Action sequence and background score is also an other highlight to the movie. A big thank you to the director for his vision and creativity. Eagerly looking forward for the next part of the movie.",Positive
11,"Same old story, bogus action scenes! Just a cheap copy of KGF. After Baahubali I have not seen any good movie from Prabhas. This was too a bore. Too many characters, took so much time for world building. If they were planning to make more movies under this franchise name, they should have focused less in world building and more on story telling. They could have progressed their world building with each new movie. This movie could not escape the shadow of KGF. People loved Yash in KGF and director tried to just copy paste those same things! And Throughout the movie, Prabhas was so expression less, I thought I was watching Arjun Kapoor!",Positive
12,"Action movies have become excessively exaggerated in Indian cinema lately. Prabhas, known for his roles post-Bahubali, seems to be stuck in a rut with repetitive movies where he remains stationary, only altering the planet's rotation. This particular film features a dozen entry scenes, with Prabhas engaging in fights without moving from a single spot, resulting in hundreds of people being chopped down. The movie appears to be heavily inspired by Game of Thrones but executed poorly, mirroring the constant shifts in the storyline.The main lead in the film resembles a mere model, standing stoically and striking poses every 5-10 minutes. The movie lacks substance, presenting a mindless and directionless action spectacle where everything seems to spiral out of control. Unfortunately, there's a sequel on the horizon, much to the dismay of the audience. It's advisable to steer clear of this film at all costs to save yourself from disappointment.",Negative
13,"Do not miss Salaar if you liked the KGF and the Salaar is next level of the KGF in terms of the action and thriller.BGM and the music was cherry on top throughout the action sequence and what a roar of the audience in the cinema when Prabhas used to enter the fighting scene.One of the best action movie of Prabhas till date what I felt, it overdelivered than the trailer and nowhere left the movie in a dilemma.Definitely can be given a try if you like the thriller or action genre.Trailer was much better compared to the movie, and even the first half was pretty much entertaining, but the 2nd half for not bearable and it was boring to the another level.Had quite expectation after the trailer as it seemed pretty entertainment kind of a of movie, however the reality was the wastage of the time and money.Better to watch Salaar instead as Salaar is full action packed movie and KGF kind of thriller and action being witnessed in Salaar.You may save your time and money by skipping Dunki and instead watch Salaar if you like action or thriller or suspense.Do not miss this combo of thriller + suspense + action delivered beautifully in a single pack.",Positive
14,"Salaar Is the best movie of prabhas after bahubali. This time Prabhas Come Back to his den.. No one can Match with his Stardom .. Dinosaur Rampage Starts Now . Prashant Neel Shows his best direction after kgf series.. Mass & Action .Goosebumps in each scene Overloaded. Prabhas looking good .When it comes to Screen Presence no one can come close to him..Biggest Superstar Of India in recent times . Prabhas himself carried the whole movie on his shoulder. . That fight scene for rescue the girl is awesome.. you can feel the emotion in his eyes , when he fights. Prvthiraj Gave his best .. All actors act well

17,Salaar is a blockbuster movie with a fantastic cast and with prabhas. Salaar managed to give greatest action sequences while giving the best story telling and this movie gave an introduction to the khansaar world and finally prabhas comeback has definately came with salaar with a blockbuster hit. We can say that after bahubali Prashant Neel is the one who utilised prabhas as he should be like S S Rajamouli showed him in chatrapati and bahubali prashanth Neel is the one again to him in salaar. People should not worry about negative reviews the movie is an absolute watch without hesitation and you will feel good you've made a right decision.,Positive

With hombale films. North Indian movie lovers just started trolling on prabhas sir only because he is competing with sharukh khan.But they don't know why hombale films and movie team decides to clash with dunki. Whole India felt proud on prabhas work when a master piece picture released named Bahubali. North audience only know about prabhas as pan Indian star but he is darling and called Rebel star ⭐. He doesn't know his standorm but people from telugu states will be wall for him. Salaar part 1 is a perfect eye feast for prabhas fans and gives the best cinematic experience to movie lovers. Unlike filling a film with nonsense fights , illogical drama and mixing of several movies scripts , it will be a benchmark for upcoming A rated and action films. #PRABHASERA.",Positive
21,"""Salaar"" unfolds as a lavish, high-quality cinematic venture, sprawling across the length and breadth of India, drawing inspiration from the Kannada film ""Ugram"" under the adept direction of the same creator. Transporting viewers to a distinct realm, the film introduces intriguing backdrops and characters, although their development falls short.Channeling the style of KGF, the treatment boasts a rich aesthetic. While dialogues lack the expected finesse, the casting is impeccable. Prabhas exhibits a notable improvement in both appearance and performance compared to his recent endeavors. Prithviraj and Sriya Reddy's portrayal stands out, with the remaining cast fulfilling their directorial mandates.Cinematography and background music shine as brilliant facets, accompanied by commendable sound effects. However, the film falters in VFX execution, sound mixing, and an excessively dark color grading. The directorial prowess is evident, but the writing doesn't quite reach the pinnacle.For an optimal viewing experience, opt for theaters equipped with superior projectors and sound systems.",Positive

And action if you compare its action with other move, then you have to go Hollywood film because no Indian cinema have action like this. True action movie. And main actor prabhash done a fabulous work hare after Bhahubali. You gonna love his hard work and also PRITHVIRAJ ji he done also good work. Salaar is not just a film it's a emotion of all prabhash fans if you missed it on theater then you missing a lot. Booked your tickets now before it's too late🏃💨.

Prashant Neel Shows his best direction after kgf series.. Mass & Action .Goosebumps in each scene Overloaded. Prabhas looking good .When it comes to Screen Presence no one can come close to him..Biggest Superstar Of India in recent times . Prabhas himself carried the whole movie on his shoulder. .

42,Salaar is a blockbuster movie with a fantastic cast and with prabhas. Salaar managed to give greatest action sequences while giving the best story telling and this movie gave an introduction to the khansaar world and finally prabhas comeback has definately came with salaar with a blockbuster hit. We can say that after bahubali Prashant Neel is the one who utilised prabhas as he should be like S S Rajamouli showed him in chatrapati and bahubali prashanth Neel is the one again to him in salaar. People should not worry about negative reviews the movie is an absolute watch without hesitation and you will feel good you've made a right decision.,Positive

45,"Salaar part 1: Cease fire is a extraordinary mass action film with lot of emotions directed by Prashant neel. Prashant neel especially made film to fulfill his dream movie thought
With hombale films. North Indian movie lovers just started trolling on prabhas sir only because he is competing with sharukh khan.But they don't know why hombale films and movie team decides to clash with dunki. Whole India felt proud on prabhas work when a master piece picture released named Bahubali. North audience only know about prabhas as pan Indian star but he is darling and called Rebel star ⭐. He doesn't know his standorm but people from telugu states will be wall for him. Salaar part 1 is a perfect eye feast for prabhas fans and gives the best cinematic experience to movie lovers. Unlike filling a film with nonsense fights , illogical drama and mixing of several movies scripts , it will be a benchmark for upcoming A rated and action films. #PRABHASERA.",Positive

Transporting viewers to a distinct realm, the film introduces intriguing backdrops and characters, although their development falls short.Channeling the style of KGF, the treatment boasts a rich aesthetic. While dialogues lack the expected finesse, the casting is impeccable. Prabhas exhibits a notable improvement in both appearance and performance compared to his recent endeavors. Prithviraj and Sriya Reddy's portrayal stands out, with the remaining cast fulfilling their directorial mandates.Cinematography and background music shine as brilliant facets, accompanied by commendable sound effects. However, the film falters in VFX execution, sound mixing, and an excessively dark color grading. The directorial prowess is evident, but the writing doesn't quite reach the pinnacle.For an optimal viewing experience, opt for theaters equipped with superior projectors and sound systems.",Positive

51,"Synopsis: The film invests significant time in world-building but falls short of captivating the audience within its narrative.First half: The initial segment is rather mediocre. While the Interval block attempts to instill excitement, the audience struggles to connect with the story from the outset. The buildup feels somewhat excessive.Second half: Exhaustive. A substantial twist at the end sets the stage for part 2, but its impact is diminished by a desire for the film to conclude. The prolonged buildup doesn't adequately match the actual scenes, resulting in a sense of loud anticipation that one wishes to end. Trimming 30 minutes from the 3-hour runtime would have made it a more engaging watch.Background music is subpar, excessively loud, creating an unwanted auditory experience. The songs merely exist without evoking much interest.Final verdict: ""Salaar"" is a film worth exploring when time permits. It has its moments of attraction, but overall, it delivers a rather lackluster cinematic journey.",Neutral
52,"Salaar has been my most-awaited film for 2023. It ticks most of the boxes for the mass movie fan in me: A mass movie focused on a single character dominance, Neel directorial which is usually a no-nonsense action movie with cracking goosebump scenes and a much awaited comeback for Prabhas who is tailor made for characters like this amongst other things. Salaar somehow touches most of these boxes but does not check it wholeheartedly.I will approach this review differently by describing how different aspects of the movie works but falls short somehow:The Plot/Story:
This is definitely the most complex storyline of a Prashant Neel movie. While the plot gets really interesting towards the end, you tend to realize that a lot of time was wasted in the first half for no good reason. Eventually the movie leaves a lot to be explored in Part 2 but I feel there could be too much left to show in Part 2 and I'm afraid there is going to be a tough job for editors. It is also quite a risky move to have not even planned to shoot Part-2 yet (which Neel has admitted in interviews) with so much left to be told.The Action:
Finally Prabhas gets his groove back with the action sequences which perfectly suit his body language. There are some great creative choices on some of the action scenes which are definitely bound to get cheers in the cinema halls although they aren't entirely logical. There are creative killings which justify the A rating but they were definitely not necessary for the plot, not that I'm complaining. But I would have definitely loved to see some more physical effort from the lead characters for some of the action scenes. At times it is just too cool and too easy.Screenplay:
Prashant Neel's strength has been screenplay over the storyline in his past movies but in Salaar it is the other way around. The movie does follow the traditional way of telling flashback stories like most mass movies but as the movie gets close to the end, there is no payback to the flashback narration. The movie ends like an interval scene which we have seen in most of the mass movies. This ending makes the first half screenplay seem pretty odd.Dialogues:
Neel's previous works have always boasted of minimal but impactful dialogues. While Uggram had some of the best written Kannada lines, KGF had very quirky and mass one liners especially with a good mix of Hindi. There aren't any trademark dialogues in Salaar which will etch in one's memory but Prabhas and Prithwiraj's does have some fun one liner exchanges. Those also serve as the little humour element in this movie. Dialogues are well written but it is not something you'd remember it for years to come.Music and Background Score:
Most of us were already slightly disappointed with the background score of Ravi Basrur in KGF 2 as compared to KGF 1. Unfortunately the background score doesn't really match up to Prabhas' screen presence and build up for most parts in the first half, especially for his introduction sequence. The music and background score does get better in the second half and there's a 'main theme music' which could have been made better use of in the first half as well. Overall, the background score falls short of creating some major goosebump moments leading up to the fight.Cinematography, Editing and Visuals:
Bhuvan Gowda continues his stellar form with some great shots and he manages to showcase Prabhas at his best. Aerial shots and shots of the city landscape totally reminds you of KGF 2 in many parts but not in a bad way. The visual effects team have done a great job in showcasing completely imaginary cities, towns and walls. The choice of using Neel's favourite dark-tone does seem excessive at times. Dare I say that they also have done a good job in digitally modifying Prabhas' looks in some scenes, and yes it is evident. While the action sequences are edited well, the same cannot be said about the shifts that we experience in some of the dramatic sequences. While the set design of Khansaar kingdom does remind you of many hollywood movies, the hair and make-up department has done an exceptional job in making each character stand out.Performances:
Neel manages to explore Prabhas' strengths perfectly by writing a role which involves him being the quiet and dangerous hero. Prabhas' performance does remind one of his Chatrapathi and other mass movie days without the unnecessary comedy and duet numbers. This is definitely the much needed comeback for Prabhas. Prithwiraj does excel as Varada Raja Mannar but at least for Part 1 there isn't any USP element for his role which makes him stand out or explore his strengths. Apart from these two, there is a plethora of supporting characters of which most of them have done nothing but justice to their role. Sriya Reddy, Bobby Simha, Garuda Ram, Madhu Guruswamy, Pramod Panju and Tinu Anand are some of the highlight performers. Of course special mention to Naveen Shankar who even with a very little screen presence makes a major impact and I am quite excited to see him in part-2. Just like the other Neel movies, we do have some creative choices for character and family names.Uggram Connection (Extra):
A lot has been discussed about this movie being a remake of Uggram, but let me assure you it's not. However Neel has straight up taken some scenes and moments from Uggram and recreated them here. He does have the creative freedom to do that considering its his own work but I personally feel that he should have admitted that to the Kannada audience. I could here some gasps of disappointment in the theatres for some of the exact scenes.Overall, Salaar makes for an almost satisfying theatrical experience but it leaves a lot of things open-ended. While it does deliver on the promise of a violent action film, it somehow fails to connect much at an emotional level. Neel continues to show how good he is at doing what he does but I feel that he does not really justify the time he has invested to bring this dinosaur finally out of its hideout.",Positive
53,"This time Prashanth's magic didn't worked out. As KGF holds up to Prashanths narration style plus Yash acting levels, Salaar has lot of dependency only on Prabhas(REBEL STAR). Story wasn't quiet interesting but elevations about second part in the movie gets the attention. Children singing song+seeking help from God+then Hero fight scenes are completely outdated. If this kind of screenplay continues its no more mass instead it makes us bore and looks like a comic. Please don't do this Mr. Neel garu.Just Prabhas makes the run time looks OK.Prabhas entry to KHANSAR: 🔥bgm remind me something like i am watching a MARVEL hero.For me personally the mother character role Eshwari garu performed little over-acting.Though the movie stood like a feast for mass fanzzz still it doesn't has much potential as expected. When i first watched kgf-1 i didn't liked it because of over hype back voice twlling about Yash but it was ok since it's all about introduction to Hero character likewise i hv satisfaction level about S🔥L🔥🔥R part 1.",Neutral

Prithviraj is too good, all the negative character roles has been done quite differently. It is not related to kgf but it gives kgf vibes also. I hope its part two will have much more than thisIt contains violence violence.If you want to see a drama, action, and if you want suspense, thriller then you must see this movie.",Positive
56,"There is no reason or point to watch the first half. Movie can directly start from the 2nd half.The pace of the film rises too fast in the 2nd half. This literally creates confusion in plot.The direction and BGM is far better in KGF.Being a pan-India and a broad film, the director must spend some time on VFX works. The VFX is too poor in some sequences, which will not make a quality film. Actors did a great work, the presence of PRABHAS filled the theatres.A commercial film.I am really waiting for the drama in khansar. The entire drama will be similar to GoT.The overall verdict - Watch it to watch SALAAR 2.",Positive

58,"Neon-drenched action and pulsating music ignite Prashanth Neel's Salaar, but beneath the dazzling surface lies a narrative wasteland. While fleeting moments of potential flicker in supporting performances, the film ultimately stumbles under the weight of its own bombast, failing to connect with audiences on an emotional level.Neel's penchant for spectacle over substance permeates the film. Thundering soundtracks and flamboyant set pieces mask a predictable plot built on overused tropes like ""friends turned enemies."" The narrative, echoing Neel's previous work, feels reheated and lacks the thematic depth and emotional resonance that captivated audiences in KGF.Prabhas, burdened by a stoic script, becomes a passive observer in his own film. His slow-motion walks and unemotional delivery fail to inject depth into the protagonist, leaving viewers struggling to connect with him or his motivations. The supporting cast, however, fares better. Prithviraj and Shriya Reddy deliver nuanced performances, hinting at the complexities their characters could have possessed had the script delved deeper.Action sequences, despite their visual flair, remain emotionally hollow. They roar with bombast but lack the raw power and thematic weight that fueled the fights in KGF. Neel throws spectacle at the screen, but it's like empty confetti - flashy and fleeting, leaving nothing behind but a sense of disappointment.Salaar's greatest sin lies not in its flaws, but in its missed potential. Glimpses of a compelling story, exploring complex relationships and emotional turmoil, flicker briefly before being extinguished by the film's relentless pursuit of spectacle. These fleeting moments serve as a painful reminder of what Salaar could have been, a film that resonated with audiences on a deeper level than mere visual thrills.Ultimately, Salaar is a disappointing detour for Neel.It descends from the raw power of KGF into a hollow spectacle, devoid of the emotional core and thematic depth that made his previous work so impactful. While sparks of potential glimmer in the supporting performances, they're not enough to salvage the overall underwhelming experience. Skip Salaar and revisit KGF for a more fulfilling encounter with Neel's directorial talent.",Positive
59,"The movie is a disappointing example of Telugu cinema's lack of originality. The first half of the movie has no clear story line and confuses the audience. It feels like random video clips are stitched together and the audience has to fill in the gaps. Some parts are so dragged out that the audience loses interest in the point. The second half of the movie is a poor imitation of Game of Thrones, with exaggerated characters and unnecessary violence. Shruthi Hasan's role is irrelevant and perplexing. The movie tries to copy the storyline where the Targaryen children are killed, but with Prabhas' tribe instead. Ultimately I was completely able to relate Prabas to John snow. The directors have wasted a huge budget on a movie that lacks creativity and coherence.",Negative
60,"Great Drama and acting. The first part has that punch that the audience is looking for, and 2nd half is full of drama and action with great storytelling in the background. Characters are clearly defined, and imagination to create the film needs to be greatly appreciated. Dev and vardha are incredible, especially their humor during the action sequence and they carry forward their friendship is the big highlight to the movie. Action sequence and background score is also an other highlight to the movie. A big thank you to the director for his vision and creativity. Eagerly looking forward for the next part of the movie.",Positive
61,"Same old story, bogus action scenes! Just a cheap copy of KGF. After Baahubali I have not seen any good movie from Prabhas. This was too a bore. Too many characters, took so much time for world building. If they were planning to make more movies under this franchise name, they should have focused less in world building and more on story telling. They could have progressed their world building with each new movie. This movie could not escape the shadow of KGF. People loved Yash in KGF and director tried to just copy paste those same things! And Throughout the movie, Prabhas was so expression less, I thought I was watching Arjun Kapoor!",Positive
62,"Action movies have become excessively exaggerated in Indian cinema lately. Prabhas, known for his roles post-Bahubali, seems to be stuck in a rut with repetitive movies where he remains stationary, only altering the planet's rotation. This particular film features a dozen entry scenes, with Prabhas engaging in fights without moving from a single spot, resulting in hundreds of people being chopped down. The movie appears to be heavily inspired by Game of Thrones but executed poorly, mirroring the constant shifts in the storyline.The main lead in the film resembles a mere model, standing stoically and striking poses every 5-10 minutes. The movie lacks substance, presenting a mindless and directionless action spectacle where everything seems to spiral out of control. Unfortunately, there's a sequel on the horizon, much to the dismay of the audience. It's advisable to steer clear of this film at all costs to save yourself from disappointment.",Negative

This literally creates confusion in plot.The direction and BGM is far better in KGF.Being a pan-India and a broad film, the director must spend some time on VFX works. The VFX is too poor in some sequences, which will not make a quality film. Actors did a great work, the presence of PRABHAS filled the theatres.A commercial film.I am really waiting for the drama in khansar. The entire drama will be similar to GoT.The overall verdict - Watch it to watch SALAAR 2.",Positive

83,"Neon-drenched action and pulsating music ignite Prashanth Neel's Salaar, but beneath the dazzling surface lies a narrative wasteland. While fleeting moments of potential flicker in supporting performances, the film ultimately stumbles under the weight of its own bombast, failing to connect with audiences on an emotional level.Neel's penchant for spectacle over substance permeates the film. Thundering soundtracks and flamboyant set pieces mask a predictable plot built on overused tropes like ""friends turned enemies."" The narrative, echoing Neel's previous work, feels reheated and lacks the thematic depth and emotional resonance that captivated audiences in KGF.Prabhas, burdened by a stoic script, becomes a passive observer in his own film. His slow-motion walks and unemotional delivery fail to inject depth into the protagonist, leaving viewers struggling to connect with him or his motivations. The supporting cast, however, fares better. Prithviraj and Shriya Reddy deliver nuanced performances, hinting at the complexities their characters could have possessed had the script delved deeper.Action sequences, despite their visual flair, remain emotionally hollow. They roar with bombast but lack the raw power and thematic weight that fueled the fights in KGF. Neel throws spectacle at the screen, but it's like empty confetti - flashy and fleeting, leaving nothing behind but a sense of disappointment.Salaar's greatest sin lies not in its flaws, but in its missed potential. Glimpses of a compelling story, exploring complex relationships and emotional turmoil, flicker briefly before being extinguished by the film's relentless pursuit of spectacle. These fleeting moments serve as a painful reminder of what Salaar could have been, a film that resonated with audiences on a deeper level than mere visual thrills.Ultimately, Salaar is a disappointing detour for Neel.It descends from the raw power of KGF into a hollow spectacle, devoid of the emotional core and thematic depth that made his previous work so impactful. While sparks of potential glimmer in the supporting performances, they're not enough to salvage the overall underwhelming experience. Skip Salaar and revisit KGF for a more fulfilling encounter with Neel's directorial talent.",Positive
84,"The movie is a disappointing example of Telugu cinema's lack of originality. The first half of the movie has no clear story line and confuses the audience. It feels like random video clips are stitched together and the audience has to fill in the gaps. Some parts are so dragged out that the audience loses interest in the point. The second half of the movie is a poor imitation of Game of Thrones, with exaggerated characters and unnecessary violence. Shruthi Hasan's role is irrelevant and perplexing. The movie tries to copy the storyline where the Targaryen children are killed, but with Prabhas' tribe instead. Ultimately I was completely able to relate Prabas to John snow. The directors have wasted a huge budget on a movie that lacks creativity and coherence.",Negative
85,"Great Drama and acting. The first part has that punch that the audience is looking for, and 2nd half is full of drama and action with great storytelling in the background. Characters are clearly defined, and imagination to create the film needs to be greatly appreciated. Dev and vardha are incredible, especially their humor during the action sequence and they carry forward their friendship is the big highlight to the movie. Action sequence and background score is also an other highlight to the movie. A big thank you to the director for his vision and creativity. Eagerly looking forward for the next part of the movie.",Positive
86,"Same old story, bogus action scenes! Just a cheap copy of KGF. After Baahubali I have not seen any good movie from Prabhas. This was too a bore. Too many characters, took so much time for world building. If they were planning to make more movies under this franchise name, they should have focused less in world building and more on story telling. They could have progressed their world building with each new movie. This movie could not escape the shadow of KGF. People loved Yash in KGF and director tried to just copy paste those same things! And Throughout the movie, Prabhas was so expression less, I thought I was watching Arjun Kapoor!",Positive
87,"Action movies have become excessively exaggerated in Indian cinema lately. Prabhas, known for his roles post-Bahubali, seems to be stuck in a rut with repetitive movies where he remains stationary, only altering the planet's rotation. This particular film features a dozen entry scenes, with Prabhas engaging in fights without moving from a single spot, resulting in hundreds of people being chopped down. The movie appears to be heavily inspired by Game of Thrones but executed poorly, mirroring the constant shifts in the storyline.The main lead in the film resembles a mere model, standing stoically and striking poses every 5-10 minutes. The movie lacks substance, presenting a mindless and directionless action spectacle where everything seems to spiral out of control. Unfortunately, there's a sequel on the horizon, much to the dismay of the audience. It's advisable to steer clear of this film at all costs to save yourself from disappointment.",Negative
88,"Do not miss Salaar if you liked the KGF and the Salaar is next level of the KGF in terms of the action and thriller.BGM and the music was cherry on top throughout the action sequence and what a roar of the audience in the cinema when Prabhas used to enter the fighting scene.One of the best action movie of Prabhas till date what I felt, it overdelivered than the trailer and nowhere left the movie in a dilemma.Definitely can be given a try if you like the thriller or action genre.Trailer was much better compared to the movie, and even the first half was pretty much entertaining, but the 2nd half for not bearable and it was boring to the another level.Had quite expectation after the trailer as it seemed pretty entertainment kind of a of movie, however the reality was the wastage of the time and money.Better to watch Salaar instead as Salaar is full action packed movie and KGF kind of thriller and action being witnessed in Salaar.You may save your time and money by skipping Dunki and instead watch Salaar if you like action or thriller or suspense.Do not miss this combo of thriller + suspense + action delivered beautifully in a single pack.",Positive

92,Salaar is a blockbuster movie with a fantastic cast and with prabhas. Salaar managed to give greatest action sequences while giving the best story telling and this movie gave an introduction to the khansaar world and finally prabhas comeback has definately came with salaar with a blockbuster hit. We can say that after bahubali Prashant Neel is the one who utilised prabhas as he should be like S S Rajamouli showed him in chatrapati and bahubali prashanth Neel is the one again to him in salaar. People should not worry about negative reviews the movie is an absolute watch without hesitation and you will feel good you've made a right decision.,Positive

102,"Salaar has been my most-awaited film for 2023. It ticks most of the boxes for the mass movie fan in me: A mass movie focused on a single character dominance, Neel directorial which is usually a no-nonsense action movie with cracking goosebump scenes and a much awaited comeback for Prabhas who is tailor made for characters like this amongst other things. Salaar somehow touches most of these boxes but does not check it wholeheartedly.I will approach this review differently by describing how different aspects of the movie works but falls short somehow:The Plot/Story:
This is definitely the most complex storyline of a Prashant Neel movie. While the plot gets really interesting towards the end, you tend to realize that a lot of time was wasted in the first half for no good reason. Eventually the movie leaves a lot to be explored in Part 2 but I feel there could be too much left to show in Part 2 and I'm afraid there is going to be a tough job for editors. It is also quite a risky move to have not even planned to shoot Part-2 yet (which Neel has admitted in interviews) with so much left to be told.The Action:
Finally Prabhas gets his groove back with the action sequences which perfectly suit his body language. There are some great creative choices on some of the action scenes which are definitely bound to get cheers in the cinema halls although they aren't entirely logical. There are creative killings which justify the A rating but they were definitely not necessary for the plot, not that I'm complaining. But I would have definitely loved to see some more physical effort from the lead characters for some of the action scenes. At times it is just too cool and too easy.Screenplay:
Prashant Neel's strength has been screenplay over the storyline in his past movies but in Salaar it is the other way around. The movie does follow the traditional way of telling flashback stories like most mass movies but as the movie gets close to the end, there is no payback to the flashback narration. The movie ends like an interval scene which we have seen in most of the mass movies. This ending makes the first half screenplay seem pretty odd.Dialogues:
Neel's previous works have always boasted of minimal but impactful dialogues. While Uggram had some of the best written Kannada lines, KGF had very quirky and mass one liners especially with a good mix of Hindi. There aren't any trademark dialogues in Salaar which will etch in one's memory but Prabhas and Prithwiraj's does have some fun one liner exchanges. Those also serve as the little humour element in this movie. Dialogues are well written but it is not something you'd remember it for years to come.Music and Background Score:
Most of us were already slightly disappointed with the background score of Ravi Basrur in KGF 2 as compared to KGF 1. Unfortunately the background score doesn't really match up to Prabhas' screen presence and build up for most parts in the first half, especially for his introduction sequence. The music and background score does get better in the second half and there's a 'main theme music' which could have been made better use of in the first half as well. Overall, the background score falls short of creating some major goosebump moments leading up to the fight.Cinematography, Editing and Visuals:
Bhuvan Gowda continues his stellar form with some great shots and he manages to showcase Prabhas at his best. Aerial shots and shots of the city landscape totally reminds you of KGF 2 in many parts but not in a bad way. The visual effects team have done a great job in showcasing completely imaginary cities, towns and walls. The choice of using Neel's favourite dark-tone does seem excessive at times. Dare I say that they also have done a good job in digitally modifying Prabhas' looks in some scenes, and yes it is evident. While the action sequences are edited well, the same cannot be said about the shifts that we experience in some of the dramatic sequences. While the set design of Khansaar kingdom does remind you of many hollywood movies, the hair and make-up department has done an exceptional job in making each character stand out.Performances:
Neel manages to explore Prabhas' strengths perfectly by writing a role which involves him being the quiet and dangerous hero. Prabhas' performance does remind one of his Chatrapathi and other mass movie days without the unnecessary comedy and duet numbers. This is definitely the much needed comeback for Prabhas. Prithwiraj does excel as Varada Raja Mannar but at least for Part 1 there isn't any USP element for his role which makes him stand out or explore his strengths. Apart from these two, there is a plethora of supporting characters of which most of them have done nothing but justice to their role. Sriya Reddy, Bobby Simha, Garuda Ram, Madhu Guruswamy, Pramod Panju and Tinu Anand are some of the highlight performers. Of course special mention to Naveen Shankar who even with a very little screen presence makes a major impact and I am quite excited to see him in part-2. Just like the other Neel movies, we do have some creative choices for character and family names.Uggram Connection (Extra):
A lot has been discussed about this movie being a remake of Uggram, but let me assure you it's not. However Neel has straight up taken some scenes and moments from Uggram and recreated them here. He does have the creative freedom to do that considering its his own work but I personally feel that he should have admitted that to the Kannada audience. I could here some gasps of disappointment in the theatres for some of the exact scenes.Overall, Salaar makes for an almost satisfying theatrical experience but it leaves a lot of things open-ended. While it does deliver on the promise of a violent action film, it somehow fails to connect much at an emotional level. Neel continues to show how good he is at doing what he does but I feel that he does not really justify the time he has invested to bring this dinosaur finally out of its hideout.",Positive
103,"This time Prashanth's magic didn't worked out. As KGF holds up to Prashanths narration style plus Yash acting levels, Salaar has lot of dependency only on Prabhas(REBEL STAR). Story wasn't quiet interesting but elevations about second part in the movie gets the attention. Children singing song+seeking help from God+then Hero fight scenes are completely outdated. If this kind of screenplay continues its no more mass instead it makes us bore and looks like a comic. Please don't do this Mr. Neel garu.Just Prabhas makes the run time looks OK.Prabhas entry to KHANSAR: 🔥bgm remind me something like i am watching a MARVEL hero.For me personally the mother character role Eshwari garu performed little over-acting.Though the movie stood like a feast for mass fanzzz still it doesn't has much potential as expected. When i first watched kgf-1 i didn't liked it because of over hype back voice twlling about Yash but it was ok since it's all about introduction to Hero character likewise i hv satisfaction level about S🔥L🔥🔥R part 1.",Neutral

While Uggram had some of the best written Kannada lines, KGF had very quirky and mass one liners especially with a good mix of Hindi. There aren't any trademark dialogues in Salaar which will etch in one's memory but Prabhas and Prithwiraj's does have some fun one liner exchanges. Those also serve as the little humour element in this movie. Dialogues are well written but it is not something you'd remember it for years to come.Music and Background Score:
Most of us were already slightly disappointed with the background score of Ravi Basrur in KGF 2 as compared to KGF 1. Unfortunately the background score doesn't really match up to Prabhas' screen presence and build up for most parts in the first half, especially for his introduction sequence. The music and background score does get better in the second half and there's a 'main theme music' which could have been made better use of in the first half as well. Overall, the background score falls short of creating some major goosebump moments leading up to the fight.Cinematography, Editing and Visuals:
Bhuvan Gowda continues his stellar form with some great shots and he manages to showcase Prabhas at his best. Aerial shots and shots of the city landscape totally reminds you of KGF 2 in many parts but not in a bad way. The visual effects team have done a great job in showcasing completely imaginary cities, towns and walls. The choice of using Neel's favourite dark-tone does seem excessive at times. Dare I say that they also have done a good job in digitally modifying Prabhas' looks in some scenes, and yes it is evident. While the action sequences are edited well, the same cannot be said about the shifts that we experience in some of the dramatic sequences. While the set design of Khansaar kingdom does remind you of many hollywood movies, the hair and make-up department has done an exceptional job in making each character stand out.Performances:
Neel manages to explore Prabhas' strengths perfectly by writing a role which involves him being the quiet and dangerous hero. Prabhas' performance does remind one of his Chatrapathi and other mass movie days without the unnecessary comedy and duet numbers. This is definitely the much needed comeback for Prabhas. Prithwiraj does excel as Varada Raja Mannar but at least for Part 1 there isn't any USP element for his role which makes him stand out or explore his strengths. Apart from these two, there is a plethora of supporting characters of which most of them have done nothing but justice to their role. Sriya Reddy, Bobby Simha, Garuda Ram, Madhu Guruswamy, Pramod Panju and Tinu Anand are some of the highlight performers. Of course special mention to Naveen Shankar who even with a very little screen presence makes a major impact and I am quite excited to see him in part-2. Just like the other Neel movies, we do have some creative choices for character and family names.Uggram Connection (Extra):
A lot has been discussed about this movie being a remake of Uggram, but let me assure you it's not. However Neel has straight up taken some scenes and moments from Uggram and recreated them here. He does have the creative freedom to do that considering its his own work but I personally feel that he should have admitted that to the Kannada audience. I could here some gasps of disappointment in the theatres for some of the exact scenes.Overall, Salaar makes for an almost satisfying theatrical experience but it leaves a lot of things open-ended. While it does deliver on the promise of a violent action film, it somehow fails to connect much at an emotional level. Neel continues to show how good he is at doing what he does but I feel that he does not really justify the time he has invested to bring this dinosaur finally out of its hideout.",Positive
128,"This time Prashanth's magic didn't worked out. As KGF holds up to Prashanths narration style plus Yash acting levels, Salaar has lot of dependency only on Prabhas(REBEL STAR). Story wasn't quiet interesting but elevations about second part in the movie gets the attention. Children singing song+seeking help from God+then Hero fight scenes are completely outdated. If this kind of screenplay continues its no more mass instead it makes us bore and looks like a comic. Please don't do this Mr. Neel garu.Just Prabhas makes the run time looks OK.Prabhas entry to KHANSAR: 🔥bgm remind me something like i am watching a MARVEL hero.For me personally the mother character role Eshwari garu performed little over-acting.Though the movie stood like a feast for mass fanzzz still it doesn't has much potential as expected.

131,"There is no reason or point to watch the first half. Movie can directly start from the 2nd half.The pace of the film rises too fast in the 2nd half. This literally creates confusion in plot.The direction and BGM is far better in KGF.Being a pan-India and a broad film, the director must spend some time on VFX works. The VFX is too poor in some sequences, which will not make a quality film. Actors did a great work, the presence of PRABHAS filled the theatres.A commercial film.I am really waiting for the drama in khansar. The entire drama will be similar to GoT.The overall verdict - Watch it to watch SALAAR 2.",Positive

133,"Neon-drenched action and pulsating music ignite Prashanth Neel's Salaar, but beneath the dazzling surface lies a narrative wasteland. While fleeting moments of potential flicker in supporting performances, the film ultimately stumbles under the weight of its own bombast, failing to connect with audiences on an emotional level.Neel's penchant for spectacle over substance permeates the film. Thundering soundtracks and flamboyant set pieces mask a predictable plot built on overused tropes like ""friends turned enemies."" The narrative, echoing Neel's previous work, feels reheated and lacks the thematic depth and emotional resonance that captivated audiences in KGF.Prabhas, burdened by a stoic script, becomes a passive observer in his own film. His slow-motion walks and unemotional delivery fail to inject depth into the protagonist, leaving viewers struggling to connect with him or his motivations. The supporting cast, however, fares better. Prithviraj and Shriya Reddy deliver nuanced performances, hinting at the complexities their characters could have possessed had the script delved deeper.Action sequences, despite their visual flair, remain emotionally hollow. They roar with bombast but lack the raw power and thematic weight that fueled the fights in KGF. Neel throws spectacle at the screen, but it's like empty confetti - flashy and fleeting, leaving nothing behind but a sense of disappointment.Salaar's greatest sin lies not in its flaws, but in its missed potential. Glimpses of a compelling story, exploring complex relationships and emotional turmoil, flicker briefly before being extinguished by the film's relentless pursuit of spectacle. These fleeting moments serve as a painful reminder of what Salaar could have been, a film that resonated with audiences on a deeper level than mere visual thrills.Ultimately, Salaar is a disappointing detour for Neel.It descends from the raw power of KGF into a hollow spectacle, devoid of the emotional core and thematic depth that made his previous work so impactful. While sparks of potential glimmer in the supporting performances, they're not enough to salvage the overall underwhelming experience. Skip Salaar and revisit KGF for a more fulfilling encounter with Neel's directorial talent.",Positive
134,"The movie is a disappointing example of Telugu cinema's lack of originality. The first half of the movie has no clear story line and confuses the audience. It feels like random video clips are stitched together and the audience has to fill in the gaps. Some parts are so dragged out that the audience loses interest in the point. The second half of the movie is a poor imitation of Game of Thrones, with exaggerated characters and unnecessary violence. Shruthi Hasan's role is irrelevant and perplexing. The movie tries to copy the storyline where the Targaryen children are killed, but with Prabhas' tribe instead. Ultimately I was completely able to relate Prabas to John snow. The directors have wasted a huge budget on a movie that lacks creativity and coherence.",Negative
135,"Great Drama and acting. The first part has that punch that the audience is looking for, and 2nd half is full of drama and action with great storytelling in the background. Characters are clearly defined, and imagination to create the film needs to be greatly appreciated. Dev and vardha are incredible, especially their humor during the action sequence and they carry forward their friendship is the big highlight to the movie. Action sequence and background score is also an other highlight to the movie. A big thank you to the director for his vision and creativity. Eagerly looking forward for the next part of the movie.",Positive
136,"Same old story, bogus action scenes! Just a cheap copy of KGF. After Baahubali I have not seen any good movie from Prabhas. This was too a bore. Too many characters, took so much time for world building. If they were planning to make more movies under this franchise name, they should have focused less in world building and more on story telling. They could have progressed their world building with each new movie. This movie could not escape the shadow of KGF. People loved Yash in KGF and director tried to just copy paste those same things! And Throughout the movie, Prabhas was so expression less, I thought I was watching Arjun Kapoor!",Positive
137,"Action movies have become excessively exaggerated in Indian cinema lately. Prabhas, known for his roles post-Bahubali, seems to be stuck in a rut with repetitive movies where he remains stationary, only altering the planet's rotation. This particular film features a dozen entry scenes, with Prabhas engaging in fights without moving from a single spot, resulting in hundreds of people being chopped down. The movie appears to be heavily inspired by Game of Thrones but executed poorly, mirroring the constant shifts in the storyline.The main lead in the film resembles a mere model, standing stoically and striking poses every 5-10 minutes. The movie lacks substance, presenting a mindless and directionless action spectacle where everything seems to spiral out of control. Unfortunately, there's a sequel on the horizon, much to the dismay of the audience. It's advisable to steer clear of this film at all costs to save yourself from disappointment.",Negative

151,"Synopsis: The film invests significant time in world-building but falls short of captivating the audience within its narrative.First half: The initial segment is rather mediocre. While the Interval block attempts to instill excitement, the audience struggles to connect with the story from the outset. The buildup feels somewhat excessive.Second half: Exhaustive. A substantial twist at the end sets the stage for part 2, but its impact is diminished by a desire for the film to conclude. The prolonged buildup doesn't adequately match the actual scenes, resulting in a sense of loud anticipation that one wishes to end. Trimming 30 minutes from the 3-hour runtime would have made it a more engaging watch.Background music is subpar, excessively loud, creating an unwanted auditory experience. The songs merely exist without evoking much interest.Final verdict: ""Salaar"" is a film worth exploring when time permits. It has its moments of attraction, but overall, it delivers a rather lackluster cinematic journey.",Neutral
152,"Salaar has been my most-awaited film for 2023. It ticks most of the boxes for the mass movie fan in me: A mass movie focused on a single character dominance, Neel directorial which is usually a no-nonsense action movie with cracking goosebump scenes and a much awaited comeback for Prabhas who is tailor made for characters like this amongst other things. Salaar somehow touches most of these boxes but does not check it wholeheartedly.I will approach this review differently by describing how different aspects of the movie works but falls short somehow:The Plot/Story:
This is definitely the most complex storyline of a Prashant Neel movie. While the plot gets really interesting towards the end, you tend to realize that a lot of time was wasted in the first half for no good reason. Eventually the movie leaves a lot to be explored in Part 2 but I feel there could be too much left to show in Part 2 and I'm afraid there is going to be a tough job for editors. It is also quite a risky move to have not even planned to shoot Part-2 yet (which Neel has admitted in interviews) with so much left to be told.The Action:
Finally Prabhas gets his groove back with the action sequences which perfectly suit his body language. There are some great creative choices on some of the action scenes which are definitely bound to get cheers in the cinema halls although they aren't entirely logical. There are creative killings which justify the A rating but they were definitely not necessary for the plot, not that I'm complaining. But I would have definitely loved to see some more physical effort from the lead characters for some of the action scenes. At times it is just too cool and too easy.Screenplay:
Prashant Neel's strength has been screenplay over the storyline in his past movies but in Salaar it is the other way around. The movie does follow the traditional way of telling flashback stories like most mass movies but as the movie gets close to the end, there is no payback to the flashback narration. The movie ends like an interval scene which we have seen in most of the mass movies. This ending makes the first half screenplay seem pretty odd.Dialogues:
Neel's previous works have always boasted of minimal but impactful dialogues. While Uggram had some of the best written Kannada lines, KGF had very quirky and mass one liners especially with a good mix of Hindi. There aren't any trademark dialogues in Salaar which will etch in one's memory but Prabhas and Prithwiraj's does have some fun one liner exchanges. Those also serve as the little humour element in this movie. Dialogues are well written but it is not something you'd remember it for years to come.Music and Background Score:

The music and background score does get better in the second half and there's a 'main theme music' which could have been made better use of in the first half as well. Overall, the background score falls short of creating some major goosebump moments leading up to the fight.Cinematography, Editing and Visuals:

Prithviraj and Sriya Reddy's portrayal stands out, with the remaining cast fulfilling their directorial mandates.Cinematography and background music shine as brilliant facets, accompanied by commendable sound effects.

176,"Synopsis: The film invests significant time in world-building but falls short of captivating the audience within its narrative.First half: The initial segment is rather mediocre. While the Interval block attempts to instill excitement, the audience struggles to connect with the story from the outset. The buildup feels somewhat excessive.Second half: Exhaustive. A substantial twist at the end sets the stage for part 2, but its impact is diminished by a desire for the film to conclude. The prolonged buildup doesn't adequately match the actual scenes, resulting in a sense of loud anticipation that one wishes to end. Trimming 30 minutes from the 3-hour runtime would have made it a more engaging watch.Background music is subpar, excessively loud, creating an unwanted auditory experience. The songs merely exist without evoking much interest.Final verdict: ""Salaar"" is a film worth exploring when time permits. It has its moments of attraction, but overall, it delivers a rather lackluster cinematic journey.",Neutral
177,"Salaar has been my most-awaited film for 2023. It ticks most of the boxes for the mass movie fan in me: A mass movie focused on a single character dominance, Neel directorial which is usually a no-nonsense action movie with cracking goosebump scenes and a much awaited comeback for Prabhas who is tailor made for characters like this amongst other things. Salaar somehow touches most of these boxes but does not check it wholeheartedly.I will approach this review differently by describing how different aspects of the movie works but falls short somehow:The Plot/Story:
This is definitely the most complex storyline of a Prashant Neel movie. While the plot gets really interesting towards the end, you tend to realize that a lot of time was wasted in the first half for no good reason. Eventually the movie leaves a lot to be explored in Part 2 but I feel there could be too much left to show in Part 2 and I'm afraid there is going to be a tough job for editors. It is also quite a risky move to have not even planned to shoot Part-2 yet (which Neel has admitted in interviews) with so much left to be told.The Action:
Finally Prabhas gets his groove back with the action sequences which perfectly suit his body language. There are some great creative choices on some of the action scenes which are definitely bound to get cheers in the cinema halls although they aren't entirely logical. There are creative killings which justify the A rating but they were definitely not necessary for the plot, not that I'm complaining. But I would have definitely loved to see some more physical effort from the lead characters for some of the action scenes. At times it is just too cool and too easy.Screenplay:
Prashant Neel's strength has been screenplay over the storyline in his past movies but in Salaar it is the other way around. The movie does follow the traditional way of telling flashback stories like most mass movies but as the movie gets close to the end, there is no payback to the flashback narration. The movie ends like an interval scene which we have seen in most of the mass movies. This ending makes the first half screenplay seem pretty odd.Dialogues:
Neel's previous works have always boasted of minimal but impactful dialogues. While Uggram had some of the best written Kannada lines, KGF had very quirky and mass one liners especially with a good mix of Hindi. There aren't any trademark dialogues in Salaar which will etch in one's memory but Prabhas and Prithwiraj's does have some fun one liner exchanges. Those also serve as the little humour element in this movie. Dialogues are well written but it is not something you'd remember it for years to come.Music and Background Score:
Most of us were already slightly disappointed with the background score of Ravi Basrur in KGF 2 as compared to KGF 1. Unfortunately the background score doesn't really match up to Prabhas' screen presence and build up for most parts in the first half, especially for his introduction sequence. The music and background score does get better in the second half and there's a 'main theme music' which could have been made better use of in the first half as well. Overall, the background score falls short of creating some major goosebump moments leading up to the fight.Cinematography, Editing and Visuals:
Bhuvan Gowda continues his stellar form with some great shots and he manages to showcase Prabhas at his best. Aerial shots and shots of the city landscape totally reminds you of KGF 2 in many parts but not in a bad way. The visual effects team have done a great job in showcasing completely imaginary cities, towns and walls. The choice of using Neel's favourite dark-tone does seem excessive at times. Dare I say that they also have done a good job in digitally modifying Prabhas' looks in some scenes, and yes it is evident. While the action sequences are edited well, the same cannot be said about the shifts that we experience in some of the dramatic sequences. While the set design of Khansaar kingdom does remind you of many hollywood movies, the hair and make-up department has done an exceptional job in making each character stand out.Performances:
Neel manages to explore Prabhas' strengths perfectly by writing a role which involves him being the quiet and dangerous hero. Prabhas' performance does remind one of his Chatrapathi and other mass movie days without the unnecessary comedy and duet numbers. This is definitely the much needed comeback for Prabhas. Prithwiraj does excel as Varada Raja Mannar but at least for Part 1 there isn't any USP element for his role which makes him stand out or explore his strengths. Apart from these two, there is a plethora of supporting characters of which most of them have done nothing but justice to their role. Sriya Reddy, Bobby Simha, Garuda Ram, Madhu Guruswamy, Pramod Panju and Tinu Anand are some of the highlight performers. Of course special mention to Naveen Shankar who even with a very little screen presence makes a major impact and I am quite excited to see him in part-2. Just like the other Neel movies, we do have some creative choices for character and family names.Uggram Connection (Extra):
A lot has been discussed about this movie being a remake of Uggram, but let me assure you it's not. However Neel has straight up taken some scenes and moments from Uggram and recreated them here. He does have the creative freedom to do that considering its his own work but I personally feel that he should have admitted that to the Kannada audience. I could here some gasps of disappointment in the theatres for some of the exact scenes.Overall, Salaar makes for an almost satisfying theatrical experience but it leaves a lot of things open-ended. While it does deliver on the promise of a violent action film, it somehow fails to connect much at an emotional level. Neel continues to show how good he is at doing what he does but I feel that he does not really justify the time he has invested to bring this dinosaur finally out of its hideout.",Positive
178,"This time Prashanth's magic didn't worked out. As KGF holds up to Prashanths narration style plus Yash acting levels, Salaar has lot of dependency only on Prabhas(REBEL STAR). Story wasn't quiet interesting but elevations about second part in the movie gets the attention. Children singing song+seeking help from God+then Hero fight scenes are completely outdated. If this kind of screenplay continues its no more mass instead it makes us bore and looks like a comic. Please don't do this Mr. Neel garu.Just Prabhas makes the run time looks OK.Prabhas entry to KHANSAR: 🔥bgm remind me something like i am watching a MARVEL hero.For me personally the mother character role Eshwari garu performed little over-acting.Though the movie stood like a feast for mass fanzzz still it doesn't has much potential as expected. When i first watched kgf-1 i didn't liked it because of over hype back voice twlling about Yash but it was ok since it's all about introduction to Hero character likewise i hv satisfaction level about S🔥L🔥🔥R part 1.",Neutral

180,"Full of action and storylines.If you like action movie then you definitely gonna love this movie.Thrill and goosebumps in every action entry of prabhas. The violent prabhas is back on track.Action scenes are too good. Every character has done great job. Shruti Hassan's work is good but not too good.Next level of friendship has been shown. Prithviraj is too good, all the negative character roles has been done quite differently. It is not related to kgf but it gives kgf vibes also. I hope its part two will have much more than thisIt contains violence violence.If you want to see a drama, action, and if you want suspense, thriller then you must see this movie.",Positive
181,"There is no reason or point to watch the first half. Movie can directly start from the 2nd half.The pace of the film rises too fast in the 2nd half. This literally creates confusion in plot.The direction and BGM is far better in KGF.Being a pan-India and a broad film, the director must spend some time on VFX works. The VFX is too poor in some sequences, which will not make a quality film. Actors did a great work, the presence of PRABHAS filled the theatres.A commercial film.I am really waiting for the drama in khansar. The entire drama will be similar to GoT.The overall verdict - Watch it to watch SALAAR 2.",Positive

183,"Neon-drenched action and pulsating music ignite Prashanth Neel's Salaar, but beneath the dazzling surface lies a narrative wasteland. While fleeting moments of potential flicker in supporting performances, the film ultimately stumbles under the weight of its own bombast, failing to connect with audiences on an emotional level.Neel's penchant for spectacle over substance permeates the film. Thundering soundtracks and flamboyant set pieces mask a predictable plot built on overused tropes like ""friends turned enemies."" The narrative, echoing Neel's previous work, feels reheated and lacks the thematic depth and emotional resonance that captivated audiences in KGF.Prabhas, burdened by a stoic script, becomes a passive observer in his own film. His slow-motion walks and unemotional delivery fail to inject depth into the protagonist, leaving viewers struggling to connect with him or his motivations. The supporting cast, however, fares better. Prithviraj and Shriya Reddy deliver nuanced performances, hinting at the complexities their characters could have possessed had the script delved deeper.Action sequences, despite their visual flair, remain emotionally hollow. They roar with bombast but lack the raw power and thematic weight that fueled the fights in KGF. Neel throws spectacle at the screen, but it's like empty confetti - flashy and fleeting, leaving nothing behind but a sense of disappointment.Salaar's greatest sin lies not in its flaws, but in its missed potential. Glimpses of a compelling story, exploring complex relationships and emotional turmoil, flicker briefly before being extinguished by the film's relentless pursuit of spectacle. These fleeting moments serve as a painful reminder of what Salaar could have been, a film that resonated with audiences on a deeper level than mere visual thrills.Ultimately, Salaar is a disappointing detour for Neel.It descends from the raw power of KGF into a hollow spectacle, devoid of the emotional core and thematic depth that made his previous work so impactful. While sparks of potential glimmer in the supporting performances, they're not enough to salvage the overall underwhelming experience. Skip Salaar and revisit KGF for a more fulfilling encounter with Neel's directorial talent.",Positive
184,"The movie is a disappointing example of Telugu cinema's lack of originality. The first half of the movie has no clear story line and confuses the audience. It feels like random video clips are stitched together and the audience has to fill in the gaps. Some parts are so dragged out that the audience loses interest in the point. The second half of the movie is a poor imitation of Game of Thrones, with exaggerated characters and unnecessary violence. Shruthi Hasan's role is irrelevant and perplexing. The movie tries to copy the storyline where the Targaryen children are killed, but with Prabhas' tribe instead. Ultimately I was completely able to relate Prabas to John snow. The directors have wasted a huge budget on a movie that lacks creativity and coherence.",Negative
185,"Great Drama and acting. The first part has that punch that the audience is looking for, and 2nd half is full of drama and action with great storytelling in the background. Characters are clearly defined, and imagination to create the film needs to be greatly appreciated. Dev and vardha are incredible, especially their humor during the action sequence and they carry forward their friendship is the big highlight to the movie. Action sequence and background score is also an other highlight to the movie. A big thank you to the director for his vision and creativity. Eagerly looking forward for the next part of the movie.",Positive
186,"Same old story, bogus action scenes! Just a cheap copy of KGF. After Baahubali I have not seen any good movie from Prabhas. This was too a bore. Too many characters, took so much time for world building. If they were planning to make more movies under this franchise name, they should have focused less in world building and more on story telling. They could have progressed their world building with each new movie. This movie could not escape the shadow of KGF. People loved Yash in KGF and director tried to just copy paste those same things! And Throughout the movie, Prabhas was so expression less, I thought I was watching Arjun Kapoor!",Positive
187,"Action movies have become excessively exaggerated in Indian cinema lately. Prabhas, known for his roles post-Bahubali, seems to be stuck in a rut with repetitive movies where he remains stationary, only altering the planet's rotation. This particular film features a dozen entry scenes, with Prabhas engaging in fights without moving from a single spot, resulting in hundreds of people being chopped down. The movie appears to be heavily inspired by Game of Thrones but executed poorly, mirroring the constant shifts in the storyline.The main lead in the film resembles a mere model, standing stoically and striking poses every 5-10 minutes. The movie lacks substance, presenting a mindless and directionless action spectacle where everything seems to spiral out of control. Unfortunately, there's a sequel on the horizon, much to the dismay of the audience. It's advisable to steer clear of this film at all costs to save yourself from disappointment.",Negative
188,"Do not miss Salaar if you liked the KGF and the Salaar is next level of the KGF in terms of the action and thriller.BGM and the music was cherry on top throughout the action sequence and what a roar of the audience in the cinema when Prabhas used to enter the fighting scene.One of the best action movie of Prabhas till date what I felt, it overdelivered than the trailer and nowhere left the movie in a dilemma.Definitely can be given a try if you like the thriller or action genre.Trailer was much better compared to the movie, and even the first half was pretty much entertaining, but the 2nd half for not bearable and it was boring to the another level.Had quite expectation after the trailer as it seemed pretty entertainment kind of a of movie, however the reality was the wastage of the time and money.Better to watch Salaar instead as Salaar is full action packed movie and KGF kind of thriller and action being witnessed in Salaar.You may save your time and money by skipping Dunki and instead watch Salaar if you like action or thriller or suspense.Do not miss this combo of thriller + suspense + action delivered beautifully in a single pack.",Positive

Prashant Neel Shows his best direction after kgf series.. Mass & Action .Goosebumps in each scene Overloaded. Prabhas looking good .When it comes to Screen Presence no one can come close to him..Biggest Superstar Of India in recent times . Prabhas himself carried the whole movie on his shoulder. .

Salaar managed to give greatest action sequences while giving the best story telling and this movie gave an introduction to the khansaar world and finally prabhas comeback has definately came with salaar with a blockbuster hit. We can say that after bahubali Prashant Neel is the one who utilised prabhas as he should be like S S Rajamouli showed him in chatrapati and bahubali prashanth Neel is the one again to him in salaar.

The movie tries to copy the storyline where the Targaryen children are killed, but with Prabhas' tribe instead. Ultimately I was completely able to relate Prabas to John snow. The directors have wasted a huge budget on a movie that lacks creativity and coherence.",Negative
210,"Great Drama and acting. The first part has that punch that the audience is looking for, and 2nd half is full of drama and action with great storytelling in the background. Characters are clearly defined, and imagination to create the film needs to be greatly appreciated. Dev and vardha are incredible, especially their humor during the action sequence and they carry forward their friendship is the big highlight to the movie. Action sequence and background score is also an other highlight to the movie. A big thank you to the director for his vision and creativity. Eagerly looking forward for the next part of the movie.",Positive
211,"Same old story, bogus action scenes! Just a cheap copy of KGF. After Baahubali I have not seen any good movie from Prabhas. This was too a bore. Too many characters, took so much time for world building. If they were planning to make more movies under this franchise name, they should have focused less in world building and more on story telling. They could have progressed their world building with each new movie. This movie could not escape the shadow of KGF. People loved Yash in KGF and director tried to just copy paste those same things! And Throughout the movie, Prabhas was so expression less, I thought I was watching Arjun Kapoor!",Positive
212,"Action movies have become excessively exaggerated in Indian cinema lately. Prabhas, known for his roles post-Bahubali, seems to be stuck in a rut with repetitive movies where he remains stationary, only altering the planet's rotation. This particular film features a dozen entry scenes, with Prabhas engaging in fights without moving from a single spot, resulting in hundreds of people being chopped down. The movie appears to be heavily inspired by Game of Thrones but executed poorly, mirroring the constant shifts in the storyline.The main lead in the film resembles a mere model, standing stoically and striking poses every 5-10 minutes. The movie lacks substance, presenting a mindless and directionless action spectacle where everything seems to spiral out of control. Unfortunately, there's a sequel on the horizon, much to the dismay of the audience. It's advisable to steer clear of this film at all costs to save yourself from disappointment.",Negative
213,"Do not miss Salaar if you liked the KGF and the Salaar is next level of the KGF in terms of the action and thriller.BGM and the music was cherry on top throughout the action sequence and what a roar of the audience in the cinema when Prabhas used to enter the fighting scene.One of the best action movie of Prabhas till date what I felt, it overdelivered than the trailer and nowhere left the movie in a dilemma.Definitely can be given a try if you like the thriller or action genre.Trailer was much better compared to the movie, and even the first half was pretty much entertaining, but the 2nd half for not bearable and it was boring to the another level.Had quite expectation after the trailer as it seemed pretty entertainment kind of a of movie, however the reality was the wastage of the time and money.Better to watch Salaar instead as Salaar is full action packed movie and KGF kind of thriller and action being witnessed in Salaar.You may save your time and money by skipping Dunki and instead watch Salaar if you like action or thriller or suspense.Do not miss this combo of thriller + suspense + action delivered beautifully in a single pack.",Positive
214,"Salaar Is the best movie of prabhas after bahubali. This time Prabhas Come Back to his den.. No one can Match with his Stardom .. Dinosaur Rampage Starts Now . Prashant Neel Shows his best direction after kgf series.. Mass & Action .Goosebumps in each scene Overloaded. Prabhas looking good .When it comes to Screen Presence no one can come close to him..Biggest Superstar Of India in recent times . Prabhas himself carried the whole movie on his shoulder. . That fight scene for rescue the girl is awesome.. you can feel the emotion in his eyes , when he fights. Prvthiraj Gave his best .. All actors act well

217,Salaar is a blockbuster movie with a fantastic cast and with prabhas. Salaar managed to give greatest action sequences while giving the best story telling and this movie gave an introduction to the khansaar world and finally prabhas comeback has definately came with salaar with a blockbuster hit. We can say that after bahubali Prashant Neel is the one who utilised prabhas as he should be like S S Rajamouli showed him in chatrapati and bahubali prashanth Neel is the one again to him in salaar. People should not worry about negative reviews the movie is an absolute watch without hesitation and you will feel good you've made a right decision.,Positive

226,"Synopsis: The film invests significant time in world-building but falls short of captivating the audience within its narrative.First half: The initial segment is rather mediocre. While the Interval block attempts to instill excitement, the audience struggles to connect with the story from the outset. The buildup feels somewhat excessive.Second half: Exhaustive. A substantial twist at the end sets the stage for part 2, but its impact is diminished by a desire for the film to conclude. The prolonged buildup doesn't adequately match the actual scenes, resulting in a sense of loud anticipation that one wishes to end. Trimming 30 minutes from the 3-hour runtime would have made it a more engaging watch.Background music is subpar, excessively loud, creating an unwanted auditory experience. The songs merely exist without evoking much interest.Final verdict: ""Salaar"" is a film worth exploring when time permits. It has its moments of attraction, but overall, it delivers a rather lackluster cinematic journey.",Neutral
227,"Salaar has been my most-awaited film for 2023. It ticks most of the boxes for the mass movie fan in me: A mass movie focused on a single character dominance, Neel directorial which is usually a no-nonsense action movie with cracking goosebump scenes and a much awaited comeback for Prabhas who is tailor made for characters like this amongst other things. Salaar somehow touches most of these boxes but does not check it wholeheartedly.I will approach this review differently by describing how different aspects of the movie works but falls short somehow:The Plot/Story:
This is definitely the most complex storyline of a Prashant Neel movie. While the plot gets really interesting towards the end, you tend to realize that a lot of time was wasted in the first half for no good reason. Eventually the movie leaves a lot to be explored in Part 2 but I feel there could be too much left to show in Part 2 and I'm afraid there is going to be a tough job for editors. It is also quite a risky move to have not even planned to shoot Part-2 yet (which Neel has admitted in interviews) with so much left to be told.The Action:
Finally Prabhas gets his groove back with the action sequences which perfectly suit his body language. There are some great creative choices on some of the action scenes which are definitely bound to get cheers in the cinema halls although they aren't entirely logical. There are creative killings which justify the A rating but they were definitely not necessary for the plot, not that I'm complaining. But I would have definitely loved to see some more physical effort from the lead characters for some of the action scenes. At times it is just too cool and too easy.Screenplay:
Prashant Neel's strength has been screenplay over the storyline in his past movies but in Salaar it is the other way around. The movie does follow the traditional way of telling flashback stories like most mass movies but as the movie gets close to the end, there is no payback to the flashback narration. The movie ends like an interval scene which we have seen in most of the mass movies. This ending makes the first half screenplay seem pretty odd.Dialogues:
Neel's previous works have always boasted of minimal but impactful dialogues. While Uggram had some of the best written Kannada lines, KGF had very quirky and mass one liners especially with a good mix of Hindi. There aren't any trademark dialogues in Salaar which will etch in one's memory but Prabhas and Prithwiraj's does have some fun one liner exchanges. Those also serve as the little humour element in this movie. Dialogues are well written but it is not something you'd remember it for years to come.Music and Background Score:
Most of us were already slightly disappointed with the background score of Ravi Basrur in KGF 2 as compared to KGF 1. Unfortunately the background score doesn't really match up to Prabhas' screen presence and build up for most parts in the first half, especially for his introduction sequence. The music and background score does get better in the second half and there's a 'main theme music' which could have been made better use of in the first half as well. Overall, the background score falls short of creating some major goosebump moments leading up to the fight.Cinematography, Editing and Visuals:
Bhuvan Gowda continues his stellar form with some great shots and he manages to showcase Prabhas at his best. Aerial shots and shots of the city landscape totally reminds you of KGF 2 in many parts but not in a bad way. The visual effects team have done a great job in showcasing completely imaginary cities, towns and walls. The choice of using Neel's favourite dark-tone does seem excessive at times. Dare I say that they also have done a good job in digitally modifying Prabhas' looks in some scenes, and yes it is evident. While the action sequences are edited well, the same cannot be said about the shifts that we experience in some of the dramatic sequences. While the set design of Khansaar kingdom does remind you of many hollywood movies, the hair and make-up department has done an exceptional job in making each character stand out.Performances:
Neel manages to explore Prabhas' strengths perfectly by writing a role which involves him being the quiet and dangerous hero. Prabhas' performance does remind one of his Chatrapathi and other mass movie days without the unnecessary comedy and duet numbers. This is definitely the much needed comeback for Prabhas. Prithwiraj does excel as Varada Raja Mannar but at least for Part 1 there isn't any USP element for his role which makes him stand out or explore his strengths. Apart from these two, there is a plethora of supporting characters of which most of them have done nothing but justice to their role. Sriya Reddy, Bobby Simha, Garuda Ram, Madhu Guruswamy, Pramod Panju and Tinu Anand are some of the highlight performers. Of course special mention to Naveen Shankar who even with a very little screen presence makes a major impact and I am quite excited to see him in part-2. Just like the other Neel movies, we do have some creative choices for character and family names.Uggram Connection (Extra):
A lot has been discussed about this movie being a remake of Uggram, but let me assure you it's not. However Neel has straight up taken some scenes and moments from Uggram and recreated them here. He does have the creative freedom to do that considering its his own work but I personally feel that he should have admitted that to the Kannada audience. I could here some gasps of disappointment in the theatres for some of the exact scenes.Overall, Salaar makes for an almost satisfying theatrical experience but it leaves a lot of things open-ended. While it does deliver on the promise of a violent action film, it somehow fails to connect much at an emotional level. Neel continues to show how good he is at doing what he does but I feel that he does not really justify the time he has invested to bring this dinosaur finally out of its hideout.",Positive
228,"This time Prashanth's magic didn't worked out. As KGF holds up to Prashanths narration style plus Yash acting levels, Salaar has lot of dependency only on Prabhas(REBEL STAR). Story wasn't quiet interesting but elevations about second part in the movie gets the attention. Children singing song+seeking help from God+then Hero fight scenes are completely outdated. If this kind of screenplay continues its no more mass instead it makes us bore and looks like a comic. Please don't do this Mr. Neel garu.Just Prabhas makes the run time looks OK.Prabhas entry to KHANSAR: 🔥bgm remind me something like i am watching a MARVEL hero.For me personally the mother character role Eshwari garu performed little over-acting.Though the movie stood like a feast for mass fanzzz still it doesn't has much potential as expected. When i first watched kgf-1 i didn't liked it because of over hype back voice twlling about Yash but it was ok since it's all about introduction to Hero character likewise i hv satisfaction level about S🔥L🔥🔥R part 1.",Neutral

Prithviraj is too good, all the negative character roles has been done quite differently. It is not related to kgf but it gives kgf vibes also. I hope its part two will have much more than thisIt contains violence violence.If you want to see a drama, action, and if you want suspense, thriller then you must see this movie.",Positive
231,"There is no reason or point to watch the first half. Movie can directly start from the 2nd half.The pace of the film rises too fast in the 2nd half. This literally creates confusion in plot.The direction and BGM is far better in KGF.Being a pan-India and a broad film, the director must spend some time on VFX works. The VFX is too poor in some sequences, which will not make a quality film. Actors did a great work, the presence of PRABHAS filled the theatres.A commercial film.I am really waiting for the drama in khansar. The entire drama will be similar to GoT.The overall verdict - Watch it to watch SALAAR 2.",Positive

233,"Neon-drenched action and pulsating music ignite Prashanth Neel's Salaar, but beneath the dazzling surface lies a narrative wasteland. While fleeting moments of potential flicker in supporting performances, the film ultimately stumbles under the weight of its own bombast, failing to connect with audiences on an emotional level.Neel's penchant for spectacle over substance permeates the film. Thundering soundtracks and flamboyant set pieces mask a predictable plot built on overused tropes like ""friends turned enemies."" The narrative, echoing Neel's previous work, feels reheated and lacks the thematic depth and emotional resonance that captivated audiences in KGF.Prabhas, burdened by a stoic script, becomes a passive observer in his own film. His slow-motion walks and unemotional delivery fail to inject depth into the protagonist, leaving viewers struggling to connect with him or his motivations. The supporting cast, however, fares better. Prithviraj and Shriya Reddy deliver nuanced performances, hinting at the complexities their characters could have possessed had the script delved deeper.Action sequences, despite their visual flair, remain emotionally hollow. They roar with bombast but lack the raw power and thematic weight that fueled the fights in KGF. Neel throws spectacle at the screen, but it's like empty confetti - flashy and fleeting, leaving nothing behind but a sense of disappointment.Salaar's greatest sin lies not in its flaws, but in its missed potential. Glimpses of a compelling story, exploring complex relationships and emotional turmoil, flicker briefly before being extinguished by the film's relentless pursuit of spectacle. These fleeting moments serve as a painful reminder of what Salaar could have been, a film that resonated with audiences on a deeper level than mere visual thrills.Ultimately, Salaar is a disappointing detour for Neel.It descends from the raw power of KGF into a hollow spectacle, devoid of the emotional core and thematic depth that made his previous work so impactful. While sparks of potential glimmer in the supporting performances, they're not enough to salvage the overall underwhelming experience. Skip Salaar and revisit KGF for a more fulfilling encounter with Neel's directorial talent.",Positive
234,"The movie is a disappointing example of Telugu cinema's lack of originality. The first half of the movie has no clear story line and confuses the audience.

He does have the creative freedom to do that considering its his own work but I personally feel that he should have admitted that to the Kannada audience. I could here some gasps of disappointment in the theatres for some of the exact scenes.Overall, Salaar makes for an almost satisfying theatrical experience but it leaves a lot of things open-ended. While it does deliver on the promise of a violent action film, it somehow fails to connect much at an emotional level. Neel continues to show how good he is at doing what he does but I feel that he does not really justify the time he has invested to bring this dinosaur finally out of its hideout.",Positive
253,"This time Prashanth's magic didn't worked out. As KGF holds up to Prashanths narration style plus Yash acting levels, Salaar has lot of dependency only on Prabhas(REBEL STAR). Story wasn't quiet interesting but elevations about second part in the movie gets the attention. Children singing song+seeking help from God+then Hero fight scenes are completely outdated. If this kind of screenplay continues its no more mass instead it makes us bore and looks like a comic. Please don't do this Mr. Neel garu.Just Prabhas makes the run time looks OK.Prabhas entry to KHANSAR: 🔥bgm remind me something like i am watching a MARVEL hero.For me personally the mother character role Eshwari garu performed little over-acting.Though the movie stood like a feast for mass fanzzz still it doesn't has much potential as expected. When i first watched kgf-1 i didn't liked it because of over hype back voice twlling about Yash but it was ok since it's all about introduction to Hero character likewise i hv satisfaction level about S🔥L🔥🔥R part 1.",Neutral

I hope its part two will have much more than thisIt contains violence violence.If you want to see a drama, action, and if you want suspense, thriller then you must see this movie.",Positive
256,"There is no reason or point to watch the first half. Movie can directly start from the 2nd half.The pace of the film rises too fast in the 2nd half. This literally creates confusion in plot.The direction and BGM is far better in KGF.Being a pan-India and a broad film, the director must spend some time on VFX works. The VFX is too poor in some sequences, which will not make a quality film. Actors did a great work, the presence of PRABHAS filled the theatres.A commercial film.I am really waiting for the drama in khansar. The entire drama will be similar to GoT.The overall verdict - Watch it to watch SALAAR 2.",Positive

258,"Neon-drenched action and pulsating music ignite Prashanth Neel's Salaar, but beneath the dazzling surface lies a narrative wasteland. While fleeting moments of potential flicker in supporting performances, the film ultimately stumbles under the weight of its own bombast, failing to connect with audiences on an emotional level.Neel's penchant for spectacle over substance permeates the film. Thundering soundtracks and flamboyant set pieces mask a predictable plot built on overused tropes like ""friends turned enemies."" The narrative, echoing Neel's previous work, feels reheated and lacks the thematic depth and emotional resonance that captivated audiences in KGF.Prabhas, burdened by a stoic script, becomes a passive observer in his own film. His slow-motion walks and unemotional delivery fail to inject depth into the protagonist, leaving viewers struggling to connect with him or his motivations. The supporting cast, however, fares better. Prithviraj and Shriya Reddy deliver nuanced performances, hinting at the complexities their characters could have possessed had the script delved deeper.Action sequences, despite their visual flair, remain emotionally hollow. They roar with bombast but lack the raw power and thematic weight that fueled the fights in KGF. Neel throws spectacle at the screen, but it's like empty confetti - flashy and fleeting, leaving nothing behind but a sense of disappointment.Salaar's greatest sin lies not in its flaws, but in its missed potential. Glimpses of a compelling story, exploring complex relationships and emotional turmoil, flicker briefly before being extinguished by the film's relentless pursuit of spectacle. These fleeting moments serve as a painful reminder of what Salaar could have been, a film that resonated with audiences on a deeper level than mere visual thrills.Ultimately, Salaar is a disappointing detour for Neel.It descends from the raw power of KGF into a hollow spectacle, devoid of the emotional core and thematic depth that made his previous work so impactful. While sparks of potential glimmer in the supporting performances, they're not enough to salvage the overall underwhelming experience. Skip Salaar and revisit KGF for a more fulfilling encounter with Neel's directorial talent.",Positive
259,"The movie is a disappointing example of Telugu cinema's lack of originality. The first half of the movie has no clear story line and confuses the audience. It feels like random video clips are stitched together and the audience has to fill in the gaps. Some parts are so dragged out that the audience loses interest in the point. The second half of the movie is a poor imitation of Game of Thrones, with exaggerated characters and unnecessary violence. Shruthi Hasan's role is irrelevant and perplexing. The movie tries to copy the storyline where the Targaryen children are killed, but with Prabhas' tribe instead. Ultimately I was completely able to relate Prabas to John snow. The directors have wasted a huge budget on a movie that lacks creativity and coherence.",Negative
260,"Great Drama and acting. The first part has that punch that the audience is looking for, and 2nd half is full of drama and action with great storytelling in the background. Characters are clearly defined, and imagination to create the film needs to be greatly appreciated. Dev and vardha are incredible, especially their humor during the action sequence and they carry forward their friendship is the big highlight to the movie. Action sequence and background score is also an other highlight to the movie. A big thank you to the director for his vision and creativity. Eagerly looking forward for the next part of the movie.",Positive
261,"Same old story, bogus action scenes! Just a cheap copy of KGF. After Baahubali I have not seen any good movie from Prabhas. This was too a bore. Too many characters, took so much time for world building. If they were planning to make more movies under this franchise name, they should have focused less in world building and more on story telling. They could have progressed their world building with each new movie. This movie could not escape the shadow of KGF. People loved Yash in KGF and director tried to just copy paste those same things! And Throughout the movie, Prabhas was so expression less, I thought I was watching Arjun Kapoor!",Positive
262,"Action movies have become excessively exaggerated in Indian cinema lately. Prabhas, known for his roles post-Bahubali, seems to be stuck in a rut with repetitive movies where he remains stationary, only altering the planet's rotation. This particular film features a dozen entry scenes, with Prabhas engaging in fights without moving from a single spot, resulting in hundreds of people being chopped down. The movie appears to be heavily inspired by Game of Thrones but executed poorly, mirroring the constant shifts in the storyline.The main lead in the film resembles a mere model, standing stoically and striking poses every 5-10 minutes. The movie lacks substance, presenting a mindless and directionless action spectacle where everything seems to spiral out of control. Unfortunately, there's a sequel on the horizon, much to the dismay of the audience. It's advisable to steer clear of this film at all costs to save yourself from disappointment.",Negative
263,"Do not miss Salaar if you liked the KGF and the Salaar is next level of the KGF in terms of the action and thriller.BGM and the music was cherry on top throughout the action sequence and what a roar of the audience in the cinema when Prabhas used to enter the fighting scene.One of the best action movie of Prabhas till date what I felt, it overdelivered than the trailer and nowhere left the movie in a dilemma.Definitely can be given a try if you like the thriller or action genre.Trailer was much better compared to the movie, and even the first half was pretty much entertaining, but the 2nd half for not bearable and it was boring to the another level.Had quite expectation after the trailer as it seemed pretty entertainment kind of a of movie, however the reality was the wastage of the time and money.Better to watch Salaar instead as Salaar is full action packed movie and KGF kind of thriller and action being witnessed in Salaar.You may save your time and money by skipping Dunki and instead watch Salaar if you like action or thriller or suspense.Do not miss this combo of thriller + suspense + action delivered beautifully in a single pack.",Positive

Prashant Neel Shows his best direction after kgf series.. Mass & Action .Goosebumps in each scene Overloaded. Prabhas looking good .When it comes to Screen Presence no one can come close to him..Biggest Superstar Of India in recent times . Prabhas himself carried the whole movie on his shoulder. .

Salaar managed to give greatest action sequences while giving the best story telling and this movie gave an introduction to the khansaar world and finally prabhas comeback has definately came with salaar with a blockbuster hit. We can say that after bahubali Prashant Neel is the one who utilised prabhas as he should be like S S Rajamouli showed him in chatrapati and bahubali prashanth Neel is the one again to him in salaar.

276,"Synopsis: The film invests significant time in world-building but falls short of captivating the audience within its narrative.First half: The initial segment is rather mediocre. While the Interval block attempts to instill excitement, the audience struggles to connect with the story from the outset. The buildup feels somewhat excessive.Second half: Exhaustive. A substantial twist at the end sets the stage for part 2, but its impact is diminished by a desire for the film to conclude. The prolonged buildup doesn't adequately match the actual scenes, resulting in a sense of loud anticipation that one wishes to end. Trimming 30 minutes from the 3-hour runtime would have made it a more engaging watch.Background music is subpar, excessively loud, creating an unwanted auditory experience. The songs merely exist without evoking much interest.Final verdict: ""Salaar"" is a film worth exploring when time permits. It has its moments of attraction, but overall, it delivers a rather lackluster cinematic journey.",Neutral
277,"Salaar has been my most-awaited film for 2023. It ticks most of the boxes for the mass movie fan in me: A mass movie focused on a single character dominance, Neel directorial which is usually a no-nonsense action movie with cracking goosebump scenes and a much awaited comeback for Prabhas who is tailor made for characters like this amongst other things. Salaar somehow touches most of these boxes but does not check it wholeheartedly.I will approach this review differently by describing how different aspects of the movie works but falls short somehow:The Plot/Story:
This is definitely the most complex storyline of a Prashant Neel movie. While the plot gets really interesting towards the end, you tend to realize that a lot of time was wasted in the first half for no good reason. Eventually the movie leaves a lot to be explored in Part 2 but I feel there could be too much left to show in Part 2 and I'm afraid there is going to be a tough job for editors. It is also quite a risky move to have not even planned to shoot Part-2 yet (which Neel has admitted in interviews) with so much left to be told.The Action:
Finally Prabhas gets his groove back with the action sequences which perfectly suit his body language. There are some great creative choices on some of the action scenes which are definitely bound to get cheers in the cinema halls although they aren't entirely logical. There are creative killings which justify the A rating but they were definitely not necessary for the plot, not that I'm complaining. But I would have definitely loved to see some more physical effort from the lead characters for some of the action scenes. At times it is just too cool and too easy.Screenplay:
Prashant Neel's strength has been screenplay over the storyline in his past movies but in Salaar it is the other way around. The movie does follow the traditional way of telling flashback stories like most mass movies but as the movie gets close to the end, there is no payback to the flashback narration. The movie ends like an interval scene which we have seen in most of the mass movies. This ending makes the first half screenplay seem pretty odd.Dialogues:
Neel's previous works have always boasted of minimal but impactful dialogues. While Uggram had some of the best written Kannada lines, KGF had very quirky and mass one liners especially with a good mix of Hindi. There aren't any trademark dialogues in Salaar which will etch in one's memory but Prabhas and Prithwiraj's does have some fun one liner exchanges. Those also serve as the little humour element in this movie. Dialogues are well written but it is not something you'd remember it for years to come.Music and Background Score:
Most of us were already slightly disappointed with the background score of Ravi Basrur in KGF 2 as compared to KGF 1. Unfortunately the background score doesn't really match up to Prabhas' screen presence and build up for most parts in the first half, especially for his introduction sequence. The music and background score does get better in the second half and there's a 'main theme music' which could have been made better use of in the first half as well. Overall, the background score falls short of creating some major goosebump moments leading up to the fight.Cinematography, Editing and Visuals:
Bhuvan Gowda continues his stellar form with some great shots and he manages to showcase Prabhas at his best. Aerial shots and shots of the city landscape totally reminds you of KGF 2 in many parts but not in a bad way. The visual effects team have done a great job in showcasing completely imaginary cities, towns and walls. The choice of using Neel's favourite dark-tone does seem excessive at times. Dare I say that they also have done a good job in digitally modifying Prabhas' looks in some scenes, and yes it is evident. While the action sequences are edited well, the same cannot be said about the shifts that we experience in some of the dramatic sequences. While the set design of Khansaar kingdom does remind you of many hollywood movies, the hair and make-up department has done an exceptional job in making each character stand out.Performances:
Neel manages to explore Prabhas' strengths perfectly by writing a role which involves him being the quiet and dangerous hero. Prabhas' performance does remind one of his Chatrapathi and other mass movie days without the unnecessary comedy and duet numbers. This is definitely the much needed comeback for Prabhas. Prithwiraj does excel as Varada Raja Mannar but at least for Part 1 there isn't any USP element for his role which makes him stand out or explore his strengths. Apart from these two, there is a plethora of supporting characters of which most of them have done nothing but justice to their role. Sriya Reddy, Bobby Simha, Garuda Ram, Madhu Guruswamy, Pramod Panju and Tinu Anand are some of the highlight performers. Of course special mention to Naveen Shankar who even with a very little screen presence makes a major impact and I am quite excited to see him in part-2. Just like the other Neel movies, we do have some creative choices for character and family names.Uggram Connection (Extra):
A lot has been discussed about this movie being a remake of Uggram, but let me assure you it's not. However Neel has straight up taken some scenes and moments from Uggram and recreated them here. He does have the creative freedom to do that considering its his own work but I personally feel that he should have admitted that to the Kannada audience.

The prolonged buildup doesn't adequately match the actual scenes, resulting in a sense of loud anticipation that one wishes to end. Trimming 30 minutes from the 3-hour runtime would have made it a more engaging watch.Background music is subpar, excessively loud, creating an unwanted auditory experience. The songs merely exist without evoking much interest.Final verdict: ""Salaar"" is a film worth exploring when time permits. It has its moments of attraction, but overall, it delivers a rather lackluster cinematic journey.",Neutral
302,"Salaar has been my most-awaited film for 2023. It ticks most of the boxes for the mass movie fan in me: A mass movie focused on a single character dominance, Neel directorial which is usually a no-nonsense action movie with cracking goosebump scenes and a much awaited comeback for Prabhas who is tailor made for characters like this amongst other things. Salaar somehow touches most of these boxes but does not check it wholeheartedly.I will approach this review differently by describing how different aspects of the movie works but falls short somehow:The Plot/Story:
This is definitely the most complex storyline of a Prashant Neel movie. While the plot gets really interesting towards the end, you tend to realize that a lot of time was wasted in the first half for no good reason. Eventually the movie leaves a lot to be explored in Part 2 but I feel there could be too much left to show in Part 2 and I'm afraid there is going to be a tough job for editors. It is also quite a risky move to have not even planned to shoot Part-2 yet (which Neel has admitted in interviews) with so much left to be told.The Action:
Finally Prabhas gets his groove back with the action sequences which perfectly suit his body language. There are some great creative choices on some of the action scenes which are definitely bound to get cheers in the cinema halls although they aren't entirely logical. There are creative killings which justify the A rating but they were definitely not necessary for the plot, not that I'm complaining. But I would have definitely loved to see some more physical effort from the lead characters for some of the action scenes. At times it is just too cool and too easy.Screenplay:
Prashant Neel's strength has been screenplay over the storyline in his past movies but in Salaar it is the other way around. The movie does follow the traditional way of telling flashback stories like most mass movies but as the movie gets close to the end, there is no payback to the flashback narration. The movie ends like an interval scene which we have seen in most of the mass movies. This ending makes the first half screenplay seem pretty odd.Dialogues:
Neel's previous works have always boasted of minimal but impactful dialogues. While Uggram had some of the best written Kannada lines, KGF had very quirky and mass one liners especially with a good mix of Hindi. There aren't any trademark dialogues in Salaar which will etch in one's memory but Prabhas and Prithwiraj's does have some fun one liner exchanges. Those also serve as the little humour element in this movie. Dialogues are well written but it is not something you'd remember it for years to come.Music and Background Score:
Most of us were already slightly disappointed with the background score of Ravi Basrur in KGF 2 as compared to KGF 1. Unfortunately the background score doesn't really match up to Prabhas' screen presence and build up for most parts in the first half, especially for his introduction sequence. The music and background score does get better in the second half and there's a 'main theme music' which could have been made better use of in the first half as well. Overall, the background score falls short of creating some major goosebump moments leading up to the fight.Cinematography, Editing and Visuals:
Bhuvan Gowda continues his stellar form with some great shots and he manages to showcase Prabhas at his best. Aerial shots and shots of the city landscape totally reminds you of KGF 2 in many parts but not in a bad way. The visual effects team have done a great job in showcasing completely imaginary cities, towns and walls. The choice of using Neel's favourite dark-tone does seem excessive at times. Dare I say that they also have done a good job in digitally modifying Prabhas' looks in some scenes, and yes it is evident. While the action sequences are edited well, the same cannot be said about the shifts that we experience in some of the dramatic sequences. While the set design of Khansaar kingdom does remind you of many hollywood movies, the hair and make-up department has done an exceptional job in making each character stand out.Performances:
Neel manages to explore Prabhas' strengths perfectly by writing a role which involves him being the quiet and dangerous hero. Prabhas' performance does remind one of his Chatrapathi and other mass movie days without the unnecessary comedy and duet numbers. This is definitely the much needed comeback for Prabhas. Prithwiraj does excel as Varada Raja Mannar but at least for Part 1 there isn't any USP element for his role which makes him stand out or explore his strengths. Apart from these two, there is a plethora of supporting characters of which most of them have done nothing but justice to their role. Sriya Reddy, Bobby Simha, Garuda Ram, Madhu Guruswamy, Pramod Panju and Tinu Anand are some of the highlight performers. Of course special mention to Naveen Shankar who even with a very little screen presence makes a major impact and I am quite excited to see him in part-2. Just like the other Neel movies, we do have some creative choices for character and family names.Uggram Connection (Extra):
A lot has been discussed about this movie being a remake of Uggram, but let me assure you it's not. However Neel has straight up taken some scenes and moments from Uggram and recreated them here. He does have the creative freedom to do that considering its his own work but I personally feel that he should have admitted that to the Kannada audience. I could here some gasps of disappointment in the theatres for some of the exact scenes.Overall, Salaar makes for an almost satisfying theatrical experience but it leaves a lot of things open-ended. While it does deliver on the promise of a violent action film, it somehow fails to connect much at an emotional level. Neel continues to show how good he is at doing what he does but I feel that he does not really justify the time he has invested to bring this dinosaur finally out of its hideout.",Positive
303,"This time Prashanth's magic didn't worked out. As KGF holds up to Prashanths narration style plus Yash acting levels, Salaar has lot of dependency only on Prabhas(REBEL STAR). Story wasn't quiet interesting but elevations about second part in the movie gets the attention. Children singing song+seeking help from God+then Hero fight scenes are completely outdated. If this kind of screenplay continues its no more mass instead it makes us bore and looks like a comic. Please don't do this Mr. Neel garu.Just Prabhas makes the run time looks OK.Prabhas entry to KHANSAR: 🔥bgm remind me something like i am watching a MARVEL hero.For me personally the mother character role Eshwari garu performed little over-acting.Though the movie stood like a feast for mass fanzzz still it doesn't has much potential as expected. When i first watched kgf-1 i didn't liked it because of over hype back voice twlling about Yash but it was ok since it's all about introduction to Hero character likewise i hv satisfaction level about S🔥L🔥🔥R part 1.",Neutral

Prithviraj is too good, all the negative character roles has been done quite differently. It is not related to kgf but it gives kgf vibes also. I hope its part two will have much more than thisIt contains violence violence.If you want to see a drama, action, and if you want suspense, thriller then you must see this movie.",Positive
306,"There is no reason or point to watch the first half. Movie can directly start from the 2nd half.The pace of the film rises too fast in the 2nd half. This literally creates confusion in plot.The direction and BGM is far better in KGF.Being a pan-India and a broad film, the director must spend some time on VFX works. The VFX is too poor in some sequences, which will not make a quality film. Actors did a great work, the presence of PRABHAS filled the theatres.A commercial film.I am really waiting for the drama in khansar. The entire drama will be similar to GoT.The overall verdict - Watch it to watch SALAAR 2.",Positive

308,"Neon-drenched action and pulsating music ignite Prashanth Neel's Salaar, but beneath the dazzling surface lies a narrative wasteland. While fleeting moments of potential flicker in supporting performances, the film ultimately stumbles under the weight of its own bombast, failing to connect with audiences on an emotional level.Neel's penchant for spectacle over substance permeates the film. Thundering soundtracks and flamboyant set pieces mask a predictable plot built on overused tropes like ""friends turned enemies."" The narrative, echoing Neel's previous work, feels reheated and lacks the thematic depth and emotional resonance that captivated audiences in KGF.Prabhas, burdened by a stoic script, becomes a passive observer in his own film. His slow-motion walks and unemotional delivery fail to inject depth into the protagonist, leaving viewers struggling to connect with him or his motivations. The supporting cast, however, fares better. Prithviraj and Shriya Reddy deliver nuanced performances, hinting at the complexities their characters could have possessed had the script delved deeper.Action sequences, despite their visual flair, remain emotionally hollow. They roar with bombast but lack the raw power and thematic weight that fueled the fights in KGF. Neel throws spectacle at the screen, but it's like empty confetti - flashy and fleeting, leaving nothing behind but a sense of disappointment.Salaar's greatest sin lies not in its flaws, but in its missed potential. Glimpses of a compelling story, exploring complex relationships and emotional turmoil, flicker briefly before being extinguished by the film's relentless pursuit of spectacle. These fleeting moments serve as a painful reminder of what Salaar could have been, a film that resonated with audiences on a deeper level than mere visual thrills.Ultimately, Salaar is a disappointing detour for Neel.It descends from the raw power of KGF into a hollow spectacle, devoid of the emotional core and thematic depth that made his previous work so impactful. While sparks of potential glimmer in the supporting performances, they're not enough to salvage the overall underwhelming experience. Skip Salaar and revisit KGF for a more fulfilling encounter with Neel's directorial talent.",Positive
309,"The movie is a disappointing example of Telugu cinema's lack of originality. The first half of the movie has no clear story line and confuses the audience. It feels like random video clips are stitched together and the audience has to fill in the gaps. Some parts are so dragged out that the audience loses interest in the point. The second half of the movie is a poor imitation of Game of Thrones, with exaggerated characters and unnecessary violence. Shruthi Hasan's role is irrelevant and perplexing. The movie tries to copy the storyline where the Targaryen children are killed, but with Prabhas' tribe instead. Ultimately I was completely able to relate Prabas to John snow. The directors have wasted a huge budget on a movie that lacks creativity and coherence.",Negative
310,"Great Drama and acting. The first part has that punch that the audience is looking for, and 2nd half is full of drama and action with great storytelling in the background. Characters are clearly defined, and imagination to create the film needs to be greatly appreciated. Dev and vardha are incredible, especially their humor during the action sequence and they carry forward their friendship is the big highlight to the movie. Action sequence and background score is also an other highlight to the movie. A big thank you to the director for his vision and creativity. Eagerly looking forward for the next part of the movie.",Positive
311,"Same old story, bogus action scenes! Just a cheap copy of KGF. After Baahubali I have not seen any good movie from Prabhas. This was too a bore. Too many characters, took so much time for world building. If they were planning to make more movies under this franchise name, they should have focused less in world building and more on story telling. They could have progressed their world building with each new movie. This movie could not escape the shadow of KGF. People loved Yash in KGF and director tried to just copy paste those same things! And Throughout the movie, Prabhas was so expression less, I thought I was watching Arjun Kapoor!",Positive
312,"Action movies have become excessively exaggerated in Indian cinema lately. Prabhas, known for his roles post-Bahubali, seems to be stuck in a rut with repetitive movies where he remains stationary, only altering the planet's rotation. This particular film features a dozen entry scenes, with Prabhas engaging in fights without moving from a single spot, resulting in hundreds of people being chopped down. The movie appears to be heavily inspired by Game of Thrones but executed poorly, mirroring the constant shifts in the storyline.The main lead in the film resembles a mere model, standing stoically and striking poses every 5-10 minutes. The movie lacks substance, presenting a mindless and directionless action spectacle where everything seems to spiral out of control. Unfortunately, there's a sequel on the horizon, much to the dismay of the audience. It's advisable to steer clear of this film at all costs to save yourself from disappointment.",Negative
313,"Do not miss Salaar if you liked the KGF and the Salaar is next level of the KGF in terms of the action and thriller.BGM and the music was cherry on top throughout the action sequence and what a roar of the audience in the cinema when Prabhas used to enter the fighting scene.One of the best action movie of Prabhas till date what I felt, it overdelivered than the trailer and nowhere left the movie in a dilemma.Definitely can be given a try if you like the thriller or action genre.Trailer was much better compared to the movie, and even the first half was pretty much entertaining, but the 2nd half for not bearable and it was boring to the another level.Had quite expectation after the trailer as it seemed pretty entertainment kind of a of movie, however the reality was the wastage of the time and money.Better to watch Salaar instead as Salaar is full action packed movie and KGF kind of thriller and action being witnessed in Salaar.You may save your time and money by skipping Dunki and instead watch Salaar if you like action or thriller or suspense.Do not miss this combo of thriller + suspense + action delivered beautifully in a single pack.",Positive

Prabhas looking good .When it comes to Screen Presence no one can come close to him..Biggest Superstar Of India in recent times . Prabhas himself carried the whole movie on his shoulder. .

Salaar managed to give greatest action sequences while giving the best story telling and this movie gave an introduction to the khansaar world and finally prabhas comeback has definately came with salaar with a blockbuster hit. We can say that after bahubali Prashant Neel is the one who utilised prabhas as he should be like S S Rajamouli showed him in chatrapati and bahubali prashanth Neel is the one again to him in salaar. People should not worry about negative reviews the movie is an absolute watch without hesitation and you will feel good you've made a right decision.,Positive

With hombale films.

Whole India felt proud on prabhas work when a master piece picture released named Bahubali. North audience only know about prabhas as pan Indian star but he is darling and called Rebel star ⭐. He doesn't know his standorm but people from telugu states will be wall for him. Salaar part 1 is a perfect eye feast for prabhas fans and gives the best cinematic experience to movie lovers.

Transporting viewers to a distinct realm, the film introduces intriguing backdrops and characters, although their development falls short.Channeling the style of KGF, the treatment boasts a rich aesthetic. While dialogues lack the expected finesse, the casting is impeccable. Prabhas exhibits a notable improvement in both appearance and performance compared to his recent endeavors. Prithviraj and Sriya Reddy's portrayal stands out, with the remaining cast fulfilling their directorial mandates.Cinematography and background music shine as brilliant facets, accompanied by commendable sound effects.

Prashant Neel Shows his best direction after kgf series.. Mass & Action .Goosebumps in each scene Overloaded. Prabhas looking good .When it comes to Screen Presence no one can come close to him..Biggest Superstar Of India in recent times . Prabhas himself carried the whole movie on his shoulder. .

342,Salaar is a blockbuster movie with a fantastic cast and with prabhas. Salaar managed to give greatest action sequences while giving the best story telling and this movie gave an introduction to the khansaar world and finally prabhas comeback has definately came with salaar with a blockbuster hit. We can say that after bahubali Prashant Neel is the one who utilised prabhas as he should be like S S Rajamouli showed him in chatrapati and bahubali prashanth Neel is the one again to him in salaar. People should not worry about negative reviews the movie is an absolute watch without hesitation and you will feel good you've made a right decision.,Positive

351,"Synopsis: The film invests significant time in world-building but falls short of captivating the audience within its narrative.First half: The initial segment is rather mediocre. While the Interval block attempts to instill excitement, the audience struggles to connect with the story from the outset. The buildup feels somewhat excessive.Second half: Exhaustive. A substantial twist at the end sets the stage for part 2, but its impact is diminished by a desire for the film to conclude. The prolonged buildup doesn't adequately match the actual scenes, resulting in a sense of loud anticipation that one wishes to end. Trimming 30 minutes from the 3-hour runtime would have made it a more engaging watch.Background music is subpar, excessively loud, creating an unwanted auditory experience. The songs merely exist without evoking much interest.Final verdict: ""Salaar"" is a film worth exploring when time permits. It has its moments of attraction, but overall, it delivers a rather lackluster cinematic journey.",Neutral
352,"Salaar has been my most-awaited film for 2023. It ticks most of the boxes for the mass movie fan in me: A mass movie focused on a single character dominance, Neel directorial which is usually a no-nonsense action movie with cracking goosebump scenes and a much awaited comeback for Prabhas who is tailor made for characters like this amongst other things. Salaar somehow touches most of these boxes but does not check it wholeheartedly.I will approach this review differently by describing how different aspects of the movie works but falls short somehow:The Plot/Story:
This is definitely the most complex storyline of a Prashant Neel movie. While the plot gets really interesting towards the end, you tend to realize that a lot of time was wasted in the first half for no good reason. Eventually the movie leaves a lot to be explored in Part 2 but I feel there could be too much left to show in Part 2 and I'm afraid there is going to be a tough job for editors. It is also quite a risky move to have not even planned to shoot Part-2 yet (which Neel has admitted in interviews) with so much left to be told.The Action:
Finally Prabhas gets his groove back with the action sequences which perfectly suit his body language. There are some great creative choices on some of the action scenes which are definitely bound to get cheers in the cinema halls although they aren't entirely logical. There are creative killings which justify the A rating but they were definitely not necessary for the plot, not that I'm complaining. But I would have definitely loved to see some more physical effort from the lead characters for some of the action scenes. At times it is just too cool and too easy.Screenplay:
Prashant Neel's strength has been screenplay over the storyline in his past movies but in Salaar it is the other way around. The movie does follow the traditional way of telling flashback stories like most mass movies but as the movie gets close to the end, there is no payback to the flashback narration. The movie ends like an interval scene which we have seen in most of the mass movies. This ending makes the first half screenplay seem pretty odd.Dialogues:
Neel's previous works have always boasted of minimal but impactful dialogues. While Uggram had some of the best written Kannada lines, KGF had very quirky and mass one liners especially with a good mix of Hindi. There aren't any trademark dialogues in Salaar which will etch in one's memory but Prabhas and Prithwiraj's does have some fun one liner exchanges. Those also serve as the little humour element in this movie. Dialogues are well written but it is not something you'd remember it for years to come.Music and Background Score:
Most of us were already slightly disappointed with the background score of Ravi Basrur in KGF 2 as compared to KGF 1. Unfortunately the background score doesn't really match up to Prabhas' screen presence and build up for most parts in the first half, especially for his introduction sequence. The music and background score does get better in the second half and there's a 'main theme music' which could have been made better use of in the first half as well. Overall, the background score falls short of creating some major goosebump moments leading up to the fight.Cinematography, Editing and Visuals:
Bhuvan Gowda continues his stellar form with some great shots and he manages to showcase Prabhas at his best. Aerial shots and shots of the city landscape totally reminds you of KGF 2 in many parts but not in a bad way. The visual effects team have done a great job in showcasing completely imaginary cities, towns and walls. The choice of using Neel's favourite dark-tone does seem excessive at times. Dare I say that they also have done a good job in digitally modifying Prabhas' looks in some scenes, and yes it is evident. While the action sequences are edited well, the same cannot be said about the shifts that we experience in some of the dramatic sequences. While the set design of Khansaar kingdom does remind you of many hollywood movies, the hair and make-up department has done an exceptional job in making each character stand out.Performances:
Neel manages to explore Prabhas' strengths perfectly by writing a role which involves him being the quiet and dangerous hero. Prabhas' performance does remind one of his Chatrapathi and other mass movie days without the unnecessary comedy and duet numbers. This is definitely the much needed comeback for Prabhas. Prithwiraj does excel as Varada Raja Mannar but at least for Part 1 there isn't any USP element for his role which makes him stand out or explore his strengths. Apart from these two, there is a plethora of supporting characters of which most of them have done nothing but justice to their role. Sriya Reddy, Bobby Simha, Garuda Ram, Madhu Guruswamy, Pramod Panju and Tinu Anand are some of the highlight performers. Of course special mention to Naveen Shankar who even with a very little screen presence makes a major impact and I am quite excited to see him in part-2. Just like the other Neel movies, we do have some creative choices for character and family names.Uggram Connection (Extra):
A lot has been discussed about this movie being a remake of Uggram, but let me assure you it's not. However Neel has straight up taken some scenes and moments from Uggram and recreated them here. He does have the creative freedom to do that considering its his own work but I personally feel that he should have admitted that to the Kannada audience. I could here some gasps of disappointment in the theatres for some of the exact scenes.Overall, Salaar makes for an almost satisfying theatrical experience but it leaves a lot of things open-ended. While it does deliver on the promise of a violent action film, it somehow fails to connect much at an emotional level. Neel continues to show how good he is at doing what he does but I feel that he does not really justify the time he has invested to bring this dinosaur finally out of its hideout.",Positive
353,"This time Prashanth's magic didn't worked out. As KGF holds up to Prashanths narration style plus Yash acting levels, Salaar has lot of dependency only on Prabhas(REBEL STAR). Story wasn't quiet interesting but elevations about second part in the movie gets the attention. Children singing song+seeking help from God+then Hero fight scenes are completely outdated. If this kind of screenplay continues its no more mass instead it makes us bore and looks like a comic. Please don't do this Mr. Neel garu.Just Prabhas makes the run time looks OK.Prabhas entry to KHANSAR: 🔥bgm remind me something like i am watching a MARVEL hero.For me personally the mother character role Eshwari garu performed little over-acting.Though the movie stood like a feast for mass fanzzz still it doesn't has much potential as expected. When i first watched kgf-1 i didn't liked it because of over hype back voice twlling about Yash but it was ok since it's all about introduction to Hero character likewise i hv satisfaction level about S🔥L🔥🔥R part 1.",Neutral

I hope its part two will have much more than thisIt contains violence violence.If you want to see a drama, action, and if you want suspense, thriller then you must see this movie.",Positive
356,"There is no reason or point to watch the first half. Movie can directly start from the 2nd half.The pace of the film rises too fast in the 2nd half. This literally creates confusion in plot.The direction and BGM is far better in KGF.Being a pan-India and a broad film, the director must spend some time on VFX works. The VFX is too poor in some sequences, which will not make a quality film. Actors did a great work, the presence of PRABHAS filled the theatres.A commercial film.I am really waiting for the drama in khansar. The entire drama will be similar to GoT.The overall verdict - Watch it to watch SALAAR 2.",Positive

358,"Neon-drenched action and pulsating music ignite Prashanth Neel's Salaar, but beneath the dazzling surface lies a narrative wasteland. While fleeting moments of potential flicker in supporting performances, the film ultimately stumbles under the weight of its own bombast, failing to connect with audiences on an emotional level.Neel's penchant for spectacle over substance permeates the film. Thundering soundtracks and flamboyant set pieces mask a predictable plot built on overused tropes like ""friends turned enemies."" The narrative, echoing Neel's previous work, feels reheated and lacks the thematic depth and emotional resonance that captivated audiences in KGF.Prabhas, burdened by a stoic script, becomes a passive observer in his own film. His slow-motion walks and unemotional delivery fail to inject depth into the protagonist, leaving viewers struggling to connect with him or his motivations. The supporting cast, however, fares better. Prithviraj and Shriya Reddy deliver nuanced performances, hinting at the complexities their characters could have possessed had the script delved deeper.Action sequences, despite their visual flair, remain emotionally hollow. They roar with bombast but lack the raw power and thematic weight that fueled the fights in KGF. Neel throws spectacle at the screen, but it's like empty confetti - flashy and fleeting, leaving nothing behind but a sense of disappointment.Salaar's greatest sin lies not in its flaws, but in its missed potential. Glimpses of a compelling story, exploring complex relationships and emotional turmoil, flicker briefly before being extinguished by the film's relentless pursuit of spectacle. These fleeting moments serve as a painful reminder of what Salaar could have been, a film that resonated with audiences on a deeper level than mere visual thrills.Ultimately, Salaar is a disappointing detour for Neel.It descends from the raw power of KGF into a hollow spectacle, devoid of the emotional core and thematic depth that made his previous work so impactful. While sparks of potential glimmer in the supporting performances, they're not enough to salvage the overall underwhelming experience. Skip Salaar and revisit KGF for a more fulfilling encounter with Neel's directorial talent.",Positive
359,"The movie is a disappointing example of Telugu cinema's lack of originality. The first half of the movie has no clear story line and confuses the audience. It feels like random video clips are stitched together and the audience has to fill in the gaps. Some parts are so dragged out that the audience loses interest in the point. The second half of the movie is a poor imitation of Game of Thrones, with exaggerated characters and unnecessary violence. Shruthi Hasan's role is irrelevant and perplexing. The movie tries to copy the storyline where the Targaryen children are killed, but with Prabhas' tribe instead. Ultimately I was completely able to relate Prabas to John snow. The directors have wasted a huge budget on a movie that lacks creativity and coherence.",Negative
360,"Great Drama and acting. The first part has that punch that the audience is looking for, and 2nd half is full of drama and action with great storytelling in the background. Characters are clearly defined, and imagination to create the film needs to be greatly appreciated. Dev and vardha are incredible, especially their humor during the action sequence and they carry forward their friendship is the big highlight to the movie. Action sequence and background score is also an other highlight to the movie. A big thank you to the director for his vision and creativity. Eagerly looking forward for the next part of the movie.",Positive
361,"Same old story, bogus action scenes! Just a cheap copy of KGF. After Baahubali I have not seen any good movie from Prabhas. This was too a bore. Too many characters, took so much time for world building. If they were planning to make more movies under this franchise name, they should have focused less in world building and more on story telling. They could have progressed their world building with each new movie. This movie could not escape the shadow of KGF. People loved Yash in KGF and director tried to just copy paste those same things! And Throughout the movie, Prabhas was so expression less, I thought I was watching Arjun Kapoor!",Positive
362,"Action movies have become excessively exaggerated in Indian cinema lately. Prabhas, known for his roles post-Bahubali, seems to be stuck in a rut with repetitive movies where he remains stationary, only altering the planet's rotation. This particular film features a dozen entry scenes, with Prabhas engaging in fights without moving from a single spot, resulting in hundreds of people being chopped down. The movie appears to be heavily inspired by Game of Thrones but executed poorly, mirroring the constant shifts in the storyline.The main lead in the film resembles a mere model, standing stoically and striking poses every 5-10 minutes. The movie lacks substance, presenting a mindless and directionless action spectacle where everything seems to spiral out of control. Unfortunately, there's a sequel on the horizon, much to the dismay of the audience. It's advisable to steer clear of this film at all costs to save yourself from disappointment.",Negative

381,"There is no reason or point to watch the first half. Movie can directly start from the 2nd half.The pace of the film rises too fast in the 2nd half. This literally creates confusion in plot.The direction and BGM is far better in KGF.Being a pan-India and a broad film, the director must spend some time on VFX works. The VFX is too poor in some sequences, which will not make a quality film. Actors did a great work, the presence of PRABHAS filled the theatres.A commercial film.I am really waiting for the drama in khansar. The entire drama will be similar to GoT.The overall verdict - Watch it to watch SALAAR 2.",Positive

383,"Neon-drenched action and pulsating music ignite Prashanth Neel's Salaar, but beneath the dazzling surface lies a narrative wasteland. While fleeting moments of potential flicker in supporting performances, the film ultimately stumbles under the weight of its own bombast, failing to connect with audiences on an emotional level.Neel's penchant for spectacle over substance permeates the film. Thundering soundtracks and flamboyant set pieces mask a predictable plot built on overused tropes like ""friends turned enemies."" The narrative, echoing Neel's previous work, feels reheated and lacks the thematic depth and emotional resonance that captivated audiences in KGF.Prabhas, burdened by a stoic script, becomes a passive observer in his own film. His slow-motion walks and unemotional delivery fail to inject depth into the protagonist, leaving viewers struggling to connect with him or his motivations. The supporting cast, however, fares better. Prithviraj and Shriya Reddy deliver nuanced performances, hinting at the complexities their characters could have possessed had the script delved deeper.Action sequences, despite their visual flair, remain emotionally hollow. They roar with bombast but lack the raw power and thematic weight that fueled the fights in KGF. Neel throws spectacle at the screen, but it's like empty confetti - flashy and fleeting, leaving nothing behind but a sense of disappointment.Salaar's greatest sin lies not in its flaws, but in its missed potential. Glimpses of a compelling story, exploring complex relationships and emotional turmoil, flicker briefly before being extinguished by the film's relentless pursuit of spectacle. These fleeting moments serve as a painful reminder of what Salaar could have been, a film that resonated with audiences on a deeper level than mere visual thrills.Ultimately, Salaar is a disappointing detour for Neel.It descends from the raw power of KGF into a hollow spectacle, devoid of the emotional core and thematic depth that made his previous work so impactful. While sparks of potential glimmer in the supporting performances, they're not enough to salvage the overall underwhelming experience. Skip Salaar and revisit KGF for a more fulfilling encounter with Neel's directorial talent.",Positive
384,"The movie is a disappointing example of Telugu cinema's lack of originality. The first half of the movie has no clear story line and confuses the audience. It feels like random video clips are stitched together and the audience has to fill in the gaps. Some parts are so dragged out that the audience loses interest in the point. The second half of the movie is a poor imitation of Game of Thrones, with exaggerated characters and unnecessary violence. Shruthi Hasan's role is irrelevant and perplexing. The movie tries to copy the storyline where the Targaryen children are killed, but with Prabhas' tribe instead. Ultimately I was completely able to relate Prabas to John snow. The directors have wasted a huge budget on a movie that lacks creativity and coherence.",Negative
385,"Great Drama and acting. The first part has that punch that the audience is looking for, and 2nd half is full of drama and action with great storytelling in the background. Characters are clearly defined, and imagination to create the film needs to be greatly appreciated. Dev and vardha are incredible, especially their humor during the action sequence and they carry forward their friendship is the big highlight to the movie. Action sequence and background score is also an other highlight to the movie. A big thank you to the director for his vision and creativity. Eagerly looking forward for the next part of the movie.",Positive
386,"Same old story, bogus action scenes! Just a cheap copy of KGF. After Baahubali I have not seen any good movie from Prabhas. This was too a bore. Too many characters, took so much time for world building. If they were planning to make more movies under this franchise name, they should have focused less in world building and more on story telling. They could have progressed their world building with each new movie. This movie could not escape the shadow of KGF. People loved Yash in KGF and director tried to just copy paste those same things! And Throughout the movie, Prabhas was so expression less, I thought I was watching Arjun Kapoor!",Positive
387,"Action movies have become excessively exaggerated in Indian cinema lately. Prabhas, known for his roles post-Bahubali, seems to be stuck in a rut with repetitive movies where he remains stationary, only altering the planet's rotation. This particular film features a dozen entry scenes, with Prabhas engaging in fights without moving from a single spot, resulting in hundreds of people being chopped down. The movie appears to be heavily inspired by Game of Thrones but executed poorly, mirroring the constant shifts in the storyline.The main lead in the film resembles a mere model, standing stoically and striking poses every 5-10 minutes. The movie lacks substance, presenting a mindless and directionless action spectacle where everything seems to spiral out of control. Unfortunately, there's a sequel on the horizon, much to the dismay of the audience. It's advisable to steer clear of this film at all costs to save yourself from disappointment.",Negative
388,"Do not miss Salaar if you liked the KGF and the Salaar is next level of the KGF in terms of the action and thriller.BGM and the music was cherry on top throughout the action sequence and what a roar of the audience in the cinema when Prabhas used to enter the fighting scene.One of the best action movie of Prabhas till date what I felt, it overdelivered than the trailer and nowhere left the movie in a dilemma.Definitely can be given a try if you like the thriller or action genre.Trailer was much better compared to the movie, and even the first half was pretty much entertaining, but the 2nd half for not bearable and it was boring to the another level.Had quite expectation after the trailer as it seemed pretty entertainment kind of a of movie, however the reality was the wastage of the time and money.Better to watch Salaar instead as Salaar is full action packed movie and KGF kind of thriller and action being witnessed in Salaar.You may save your time and money by skipping Dunki and instead watch Salaar if you like action or thriller or suspense.Do not miss this combo of thriller + suspense + action delivered beautifully in a single pack.",Positive

Salaar managed to give greatest action sequences while giving the best story telling and this movie gave an introduction to the khansaar world and finally prabhas comeback has definately came with salaar with a blockbuster hit. We can say that after bahubali Prashant Neel is the one who utilised prabhas as he should be like S S Rajamouli showed him in chatrapati and bahubali prashanth Neel is the one again to him in salaar. People should not worry about negative reviews the movie is an absolute watch without hesitation and you will feel good you've made a right decision.,Positive

402,"Salaar has been my most-awaited film for 2023. It ticks most of the boxes for the mass movie fan in me: A mass movie focused on a single character dominance, Neel directorial which is usually a no-nonsense action movie with cracking goosebump scenes and a much awaited comeback for Prabhas who is tailor made for characters like this amongst other things. Salaar somehow touches most of these boxes but does not check it wholeheartedly.I will approach this review differently by describing how different aspects of the movie works but falls short somehow:The Plot/Story:
This is definitely the most complex storyline of a Prashant Neel movie. While the plot gets really interesting towards the end, you tend to realize that a lot of time was wasted in the first half for no good reason. Eventually the movie leaves a lot to be explored in Part 2 but I feel there could be too much left to show in Part 2 and I'm afraid there is going to be a tough job for editors. It is also quite a risky move to have not even planned to shoot Part-2 yet (which Neel has admitted in interviews) with so much left to be told.The Action:
Finally Prabhas gets his groove back with the action sequences which perfectly suit his body language. There are some great creative choices on some of the action scenes which are definitely bound to get cheers in the cinema halls although they aren't entirely logical. There are creative killings which justify the A rating but they were definitely not necessary for the plot, not that I'm complaining. But I would have definitely loved to see some more physical effort from the lead characters for some of the action scenes. At times it is just too cool and too easy.Screenplay:
Prashant Neel's strength has been screenplay over the storyline in his past movies but in Salaar it is the other way around. The movie does follow the traditional way of telling flashback stories like most mass movies but as the movie gets close to the end, there is no payback to the flashback narration. The movie ends like an interval scene which we have seen in most of the mass movies. This ending makes the first half screenplay seem pretty odd.Dialogues:
Neel's previous works have always boasted of minimal but impactful dialogues. While Uggram had some of the best written Kannada lines, KGF had very quirky and mass one liners especially with a good mix of Hindi. There aren't any trademark dialogues in Salaar which will etch in one's memory but Prabhas and Prithwiraj's does have some fun one liner exchanges. Those also serve as the little humour element in this movie. Dialogues are well written but it is not something you'd remember it for years to come.Music and Background Score:
Most of us were already slightly disappointed with the background score of Ravi Basrur in KGF 2 as compared to KGF 1. Unfortunately the background score doesn't really match up to Prabhas' screen presence and build up for most parts in the first half, especially for his introduction sequence. The music and background score does get better in the second half and there's a 'main theme music' which could have been made better use of in the first half as well. Overall, the background score falls short of creating some major goosebump moments leading up to the fight.Cinematography, Editing and Visuals:
Bhuvan Gowda continues his stellar form with some great shots and he manages to showcase Prabhas at his best. Aerial shots and shots of the city landscape totally reminds you of KGF 2 in many parts but not in a bad way. The visual effects team have done a great job in showcasing completely imaginary cities, towns and walls. The choice of using Neel's favourite dark-tone does seem excessive at times. Dare I say that they also have done a good job in digitally modifying Prabhas' looks in some scenes, and yes it is evident. While the action sequences are edited well, the same cannot be said about the shifts that we experience in some of the dramatic sequences. While the set design of Khansaar kingdom does remind you of many hollywood movies, the hair and make-up department has done an exceptional job in making each character stand out.Performances:
Neel manages to explore Prabhas' strengths perfectly by writing a role which involves him being the quiet and dangerous hero. Prabhas' performance does remind one of his Chatrapathi and other mass movie days without the unnecessary comedy and duet numbers. This is definitely the much needed comeback for Prabhas. Prithwiraj does excel as Varada Raja Mannar but at least for Part 1 there isn't any USP element for his role which makes him stand out or explore his strengths. Apart from these two, there is a plethora of supporting characters of which most of them have done nothing but justice to their role. Sriya Reddy, Bobby Simha, Garuda Ram, Madhu Guruswamy, Pramod Panju and Tinu Anand are some of the highlight performers. Of course special mention to Naveen Shankar who even with a very little screen presence makes a major impact and I am quite excited to see him in part-2. Just like the other Neel movies, we do have some creative choices for character and family names.Uggram Connection (Extra):
A lot has been discussed about this movie being a remake of Uggram, but let me assure you it's not. However Neel has straight up taken some scenes and moments from Uggram and recreated them here. He does have the creative freedom to do that considering its his own work but I personally feel that he should have admitted that to the Kannada audience. I could here some gasps of disappointment in the theatres for some of the exact scenes.Overall, Salaar makes for an almost satisfying theatrical experience but it leaves a lot of things open-ended. While it does deliver on the promise of a violent action film, it somehow fails to connect much at an emotional level. Neel continues to show how good he is at doing what he does but I feel that he does not really justify the time he has invested to bring this dinosaur finally out of its hideout.",Positive
403,"This time Prashanth's magic didn't worked out. As KGF holds up to Prashanths narration style plus Yash acting levels, Salaar has lot of dependency only on Prabhas(REBEL STAR). Story wasn't quiet interesting but elevations about second part in the movie gets the attention. Children singing song+seeking help from God+then Hero fight scenes are completely outdated. If this kind of screenplay continues its no more mass instead it makes us bore and looks like a comic. Please don't do this Mr. Neel garu.Just Prabhas makes the run time looks OK.Prabhas entry to KHANSAR: 🔥bgm remind me something like i am watching a MARVEL hero.For me personally the mother character role Eshwari garu performed little over-acting.Though the movie stood like a feast for mass fanzzz still it doesn't has much potential as expected. When i first watched kgf-1 i didn't liked it because of over hype back voice twlling about Yash but it was ok since it's all about introduction to Hero character likewise i hv satisfaction level about S🔥L🔥🔥R part 1.",Neutral

The movie ends like an interval scene which we have seen in most of the mass movies. This ending makes the first half screenplay seem pretty odd.Dialogues:
Neel's previous works have always boasted of minimal but impactful dialogues. While Uggram had some of the best written Kannada lines, KGF had very quirky and mass one liners especially with a good mix of Hindi. There aren't any trademark dialogues in Salaar which will etch in one's memory but Prabhas and Prithwiraj's does have some fun one liner exchanges. Those also serve as the little humour element in this movie. Dialogues are well written but it is not something you'd remember it for years to come.Music and Background Score:
Most of us were already slightly disappointed with the background score of Ravi Basrur in KGF 2 as compared to KGF 1. Unfortunately the background score doesn't really match up to Prabhas' screen presence and build up for most parts in the first half, especially for his introduction sequence. The music and background score does get better in the second half and there's a 'main theme music' which could have been made better use of in the first half as well. Overall, the background score falls short of creating some major goosebump moments leading up to the fight.Cinematography, Editing and Visuals:
Bhuvan Gowda continues his stellar form with some great shots and he manages to showcase Prabhas at his best. Aerial shots and shots of the city landscape totally reminds you of KGF 2 in many parts but not in a bad way. The visual effects team have done a great job in showcasing completely imaginary cities, towns and walls. The choice of using Neel's favourite dark-tone does seem excessive at times. Dare I say that they also have done a good job in digitally modifying Prabhas' looks in some scenes, and yes it is evident. While the action sequences are edited well, the same cannot be said about the shifts that we experience in some of the dramatic sequences. While the set design of Khansaar kingdom does remind you of many hollywood movies, the hair and make-up department has done an exceptional job in making each character stand out.Performances:
Neel manages to explore Prabhas' strengths perfectly by writing a role which involves him being the quiet and dangerous hero. Prabhas' performance does remind one of his Chatrapathi and other mass movie days without the unnecessary comedy and duet numbers. This is definitely the much needed comeback for Prabhas. Prithwiraj does excel as Varada Raja Mannar but at least for Part 1 there isn't any USP element for his role which makes him stand out or explore his strengths. Apart from these two, there is a plethora of supporting characters of which most of them have done nothing but justice to their role. Sriya Reddy, Bobby Simha, Garuda Ram, Madhu Guruswamy, Pramod Panju and Tinu Anand are some of the highlight performers. Of course special mention to Naveen Shankar who even with a very little screen presence makes a major impact and I am quite excited to see him in part-2. Just like the other Neel movies, we do have some creative choices for character and family names.Uggram Connection (Extra):
A lot has been discussed about this movie being a remake of Uggram, but let me assure you it's not. However Neel has straight up taken some scenes and moments from Uggram and recreated them here. He does have the creative freedom to do that considering its his own work but I personally feel that he should have admitted that to the Kannada audience. I could here some gasps of disappointment in the theatres for some of the exact scenes.Overall, Salaar makes for an almost satisfying theatrical experience but it leaves a lot of things open-ended. While it does deliver on the promise of a violent action film, it somehow fails to connect much at an emotional level. Neel continues to show how good he is at doing what he does but I feel that he does not really justify the time he has invested to bring this dinosaur finally out of its hideout.",Positive
428,"This time Prashanth's magic didn't worked out. As KGF holds up to Prashanths narration style plus Yash acting levels, Salaar has lot of dependency only on Prabhas(REBEL STAR). Story wasn't quiet interesting but elevations about second part in the movie gets the attention. Children singing song+seeking help from God+then Hero fight scenes are completely outdated. If this kind of screenplay continues its no more mass instead it makes us bore and looks like a comic. Please don't do this Mr. Neel garu.Just Prabhas makes the run time looks OK.Prabhas entry to KHANSAR: 🔥bgm remind me something like i am watching a MARVEL hero.For me personally the mother character role Eshwari garu performed little over-acting.Though the movie stood like a feast for mass fanzzz still it doesn't has much potential as expected.

431,"There is no reason or point to watch the first half. Movie can directly start from the 2nd half.The pace of the film rises too fast in the 2nd half. This literally creates confusion in plot.The direction and BGM is far better in KGF.Being a pan-India and a broad film, the director must spend some time on VFX works. The VFX is too poor in some sequences, which will not make a quality film. Actors did a great work, the presence of PRABHAS filled the theatres.A commercial film.I am really waiting for the drama in khansar.

433,"Neon-drenched action and pulsating music ignite Prashanth Neel's Salaar, but beneath the dazzling surface lies a narrative wasteland. While fleeting moments of potential flicker in supporting performances, the film ultimately stumbles under the weight of its own bombast, failing to connect with audiences on an emotional level.Neel's penchant for spectacle over substance permeates the film. Thundering soundtracks and flamboyant set pieces mask a predictable plot built on overused tropes like ""friends turned enemies."" The narrative, echoing Neel's previous work, feels reheated and lacks the thematic depth and emotional resonance that captivated audiences in KGF.Prabhas, burdened by a stoic script, becomes a passive observer in his own film. His slow-motion walks and unemotional delivery fail to inject depth into the protagonist, leaving viewers struggling to connect with him or his motivations. The supporting cast, however, fares better. Prithviraj and Shriya Reddy deliver nuanced performances, hinting at the complexities their characters could have possessed had the script delved deeper.Action sequences, despite their visual flair, remain emotionally hollow. They roar with bombast but lack the raw power and thematic weight that fueled the fights in KGF. Neel throws spectacle at the screen, but it's like empty confetti - flashy and fleeting, leaving nothing behind but a sense of disappointment.Salaar's greatest sin lies not in its flaws, but in its missed potential. Glimpses of a compelling story, exploring complex relationships and emotional turmoil, flicker briefly before being extinguished by the film's relentless pursuit of spectacle. These fleeting moments serve as a painful reminder of what Salaar could have been, a film that resonated with audiences on a deeper level than mere visual thrills.Ultimately, Salaar is a disappointing detour for Neel.It descends from the raw power of KGF into a hollow spectacle, devoid of the emotional core and thematic depth that made his previous work so impactful. While sparks of potential glimmer in the supporting performances, they're not enough to salvage the overall underwhelming experience. Skip Salaar and revisit KGF for a more fulfilling encounter with Neel's directorial talent.",Positive
434,"The movie is a disappointing example of Telugu cinema's lack of originality. The first half of the movie has no clear story line and confuses the audience. It feels like random video clips are stitched together and the audience has to fill in the gaps. Some parts are so dragged out that the audience loses interest in the point. The second half of the movie is a poor imitation of Game of Thrones, with exaggerated characters and unnecessary violence. Shruthi Hasan's role is irrelevant and perplexing. The movie tries to copy the storyline where the Targaryen children are killed, but with Prabhas' tribe instead. Ultimately I was completely able to relate Prabas to John snow. The directors have wasted a huge budget on a movie that lacks creativity and coherence.",Negative
435,"Great Drama and acting. The first part has that punch that the audience is looking for, and 2nd half is full of drama and action with great storytelling in the background. Characters are clearly defined, and imagination to create the film needs to be greatly appreciated. Dev and vardha are incredible, especially their humor during the action sequence and they carry forward their friendship is the big highlight to the movie. Action sequence and background score is also an other highlight to the movie. A big thank you to the director for his vision and creativity. Eagerly looking forward for the next part of the movie.",Positive
436,"Same old story, bogus action scenes! Just a cheap copy of KGF. After Baahubali I have not seen any good movie from Prabhas. This was too a bore. Too many characters, took so much time for world building. If they were planning to make more movies under this franchise name, they should have focused less in world building and more on story telling. They could have progressed their world building with each new movie. This movie could not escape the shadow of KGF. People loved Yash in KGF and director tried to just copy paste those same things! And Throughout the movie, Prabhas was so expression less, I thought I was watching Arjun Kapoor!",Positive
437,"Action movies have become excessively exaggerated in Indian cinema lately. Prabhas, known for his roles post-Bahubali, seems to be stuck in a rut with repetitive movies where he remains stationary, only altering the planet's rotation. This particular film features a dozen entry scenes, with Prabhas engaging in fights without moving from a single spot, resulting in hundreds of people being chopped down. The movie appears to be heavily inspired by Game of Thrones but executed poorly, mirroring the constant shifts in the storyline.The main lead in the film resembles a mere model, standing stoically and striking poses every 5-10 minutes. The movie lacks substance, presenting a mindless and directionless action spectacle where everything seems to spiral out of control. Unfortunately, there's a sequel on the horizon, much to the dismay of the audience. It's advisable to steer clear of this film at all costs to save yourself from disappointment.",Negative

451,"Synopsis: The film invests significant time in world-building but falls short of captivating the audience within its narrative.First half: The initial segment is rather mediocre. While the Interval block attempts to instill excitement, the audience struggles to connect with the story from the outset. The buildup feels somewhat excessive.Second half: Exhaustive. A substantial twist at the end sets the stage for part 2, but its impact is diminished by a desire for the film to conclude. The prolonged buildup doesn't adequately match the actual scenes, resulting in a sense of loud anticipation that one wishes to end. Trimming 30 minutes from the 3-hour runtime would have made it a more engaging watch.Background music is subpar, excessively loud, creating an unwanted auditory experience. The songs merely exist without evoking much interest.Final verdict: ""Salaar"" is a film worth exploring when time permits. It has its moments of attraction, but overall, it delivers a rather lackluster cinematic journey.",Neutral
452,"Salaar has been my most-awaited film for 2023. It ticks most of the boxes for the mass movie fan in me: A mass movie focused on a single character dominance, Neel directorial which is usually a no-nonsense action movie with cracking goosebump scenes and a much awaited comeback for Prabhas who is tailor made for characters like this amongst other things. Salaar somehow touches most of these boxes but does not check it wholeheartedly.I will approach this review differently by describing how different aspects of the movie works but falls short somehow:The Plot/Story:
This is definitely the most complex storyline of a Prashant Neel movie. While the plot gets really interesting towards the end, you tend to realize that a lot of time was wasted in the first half for no good reason. Eventually the movie leaves a lot to be explored in Part 2 but I feel there could be too much left to show in Part 2 and I'm afraid there is going to be a tough job for editors. It is also quite a risky move to have not even planned to shoot Part-2 yet (which Neel has admitted in interviews) with so much left to be told.The Action:
Finally Prabhas gets his groove back with the action sequences which perfectly suit his body language. There are some great creative choices on some of the action scenes which are definitely bound to get cheers in the cinema halls although they aren't entirely logical. There are creative killings which justify the A rating but they were definitely not necessary for the plot, not that I'm complaining. But I would have definitely loved to see some more physical effort from the lead characters for some of the action scenes. At times it is just too cool and too easy.Screenplay:
Prashant Neel's strength has been screenplay over the storyline in his past movies but in Salaar it is the other way around. The movie does follow the traditional way of telling flashback stories like most mass movies but as the movie gets close to the end, there is no payback to the flashback narration.

He doesn't know his standorm but people from telugu states will be wall for him. Salaar part 1 is a perfect eye feast for prabhas fans and gives the best cinematic experience to movie lovers. Unlike filling a film with nonsense fights , illogical drama and mixing of several movies scripts , it will be a benchmark for upcoming A rated and action films. #PRABHASERA.",Positive

476,"Synopsis: The film invests significant time in world-building but falls short of captivating the audience within its narrative.First half: The initial segment is rather mediocre. While the Interval block attempts to instill excitement, the audience struggles to connect with the story from the outset. The buildup feels somewhat excessive.Second half: Exhaustive. A substantial twist at the end sets the stage for part 2, but its impact is diminished by a desire for the film to conclude. The prolonged buildup doesn't adequately match the actual scenes, resulting in a sense of loud anticipation that one wishes to end. Trimming 30 minutes from the 3-hour runtime would have made it a more engaging watch.Background music is subpar, excessively loud, creating an unwanted auditory experience. The songs merely exist without evoking much interest.Final verdict: ""Salaar"" is a film worth exploring when time permits. It has its moments of attraction, but overall, it delivers a rather lackluster cinematic journey.",Neutral
477,"Salaar has been my most-awaited film for 2023. It ticks most of the boxes for the mass movie fan in me: A mass movie focused on a single character dominance, Neel directorial which is usually a no-nonsense action movie with cracking goosebump scenes and a much awaited comeback for Prabhas who is tailor made for characters like this amongst other things. Salaar somehow touches most of these boxes but does not check it wholeheartedly.I will approach this review differently by describing how different aspects of the movie works but falls short somehow:The Plot/Story:
This is definitely the most complex storyline of a Prashant Neel movie. While the plot gets really interesting towards the end, you tend to realize that a lot of time was wasted in the first half for no good reason. Eventually the movie leaves a lot to be explored in Part 2 but I feel there could be too much left to show in Part 2 and I'm afraid there is going to be a tough job for editors. It is also quite a risky move to have not even planned to shoot Part-2 yet (which Neel has admitted in interviews) with so much left to be told.The Action:
Finally Prabhas gets his groove back with the action sequences which perfectly suit his body language. There are some great creative choices on some of the action scenes which are definitely bound to get cheers in the cinema halls although they aren't entirely logical. There are creative killings which justify the A rating but they were definitely not necessary for the plot, not that I'm complaining. But I would have definitely loved to see some more physical effort from the lead characters for some of the action scenes. At times it is just too cool and too easy.Screenplay:
Prashant Neel's strength has been screenplay over the storyline in his past movies but in Salaar it is the other way around. The movie does follow the traditional way of telling flashback stories like most mass movies but as the movie gets close to the end, there is no payback to the flashback narration. The movie ends like an interval scene which we have seen in most of the mass movies. This ending makes the first half screenplay seem pretty odd.Dialogues:
Neel's previous works have always boasted of minimal but impactful dialogues. While Uggram had some of the best written Kannada lines, KGF had very quirky and mass one liners especially with a good mix of Hindi. There aren't any trademark dialogues in Salaar which will etch in one's memory but Prabhas and Prithwiraj's does have some fun one liner exchanges. Those also serve as the little humour element in this movie. Dialogues are well written but it is not something you'd remember it for years to come.Music and Background Score:
Most of us were already slightly disappointed with the background score of Ravi Basrur in KGF 2 as compared to KGF 1. Unfortunately the background score doesn't really match up to Prabhas' screen presence and build up for most parts in the first half, especially for his introduction sequence. The music and background score does get better in the second half and there's a 'main theme music' which could have been made better use of in the first half as well. Overall, the background score falls short of creating some major goosebump moments leading up to the fight.Cinematography, Editing and Visuals:
Bhuvan Gowda continues his stellar form with some great shots and he manages to showcase Prabhas at his best. Aerial shots and shots of the city landscape totally reminds you of KGF 2 in many parts but not in a bad way. The visual effects team have done a great job in showcasing completely imaginary cities, towns and walls. The choice of using Neel's favourite dark-tone does seem excessive at times. Dare I say that they also have done a good job in digitally modifying Prabhas' looks in some scenes, and yes it is evident. While the action sequences are edited well, the same cannot be said about the shifts that we experience in some of the dramatic sequences. While the set design of Khansaar kingdom does remind you of many hollywood movies, the hair and make-up department has done an exceptional job in making each character stand out.Performances:
Neel manages to explore Prabhas' strengths perfectly by writing a role which involves him being the quiet and dangerous hero. Prabhas' performance does remind one of his Chatrapathi and other mass movie days without the unnecessary comedy and duet numbers. This is definitely the much needed comeback for Prabhas. Prithwiraj does excel as Varada Raja Mannar but at least for Part 1 there isn't any USP element for his role which makes him stand out or explore his strengths. Apart from these two, there is a plethora of supporting characters of which most of them have done nothing but justice to their role. Sriya Reddy, Bobby Simha, Garuda Ram, Madhu Guruswamy, Pramod Panju and Tinu Anand are some of the highlight performers. Of course special mention to Naveen Shankar who even with a very little screen presence makes a major impact and I am quite excited to see him in part-2. Just like the other Neel movies, we do have some creative choices for character and family names.Uggram Connection (Extra):
A lot has been discussed about this movie being a remake of Uggram, but let me assure you it's not. However Neel has straight up taken some scenes and moments from Uggram and recreated them here. He does have the creative freedom to do that considering its his own work but I personally feel that he should have admitted that to the Kannada audience. I could here some gasps of disappointment in the theatres for some of the exact scenes.Overall, Salaar makes for an almost satisfying theatrical experience but it leaves a lot of things open-ended. While it does deliver on the promise of a violent action film, it somehow fails to connect much at an emotional level. Neel continues to show how good he is at doing what he does but I feel that he does not really justify the time he has invested to bring this dinosaur finally out of its hideout.",Positive
478,"This time Prashanth's magic didn't worked out. As KGF holds up to Prashanths narration style plus Yash acting levels, Salaar has lot of dependency only on Prabhas(REBEL STAR). Story wasn't quiet interesting but elevations about second part in the movie gets the attention. Children singing song+seeking help from God+then Hero fight scenes are completely outdated. If this kind of screenplay continues its no more mass instead it makes us bore and looks like a comic. Please don't do this Mr. Neel garu.Just Prabhas makes the run time looks OK.Prabhas entry to KHANSAR: 🔥bgm remind me something like i am watching a MARVEL hero.For me personally the mother character role Eshwari garu performed little over-acting.Though the movie stood like a feast for mass fanzzz still it doesn't has much potential as expected. When i first watched kgf-1 i didn't liked it because of over hype back voice twlling about Yash but it was ok since it's all about introduction to Hero character likewise i hv satisfaction level about S🔥L🔥🔥R part 1.",Neutral

Prithviraj is too good, all the negative character roles has been done quite differently. It is not related to kgf but it gives kgf vibes also. I hope its part two will have much more than thisIt contains violence violence.If you want to see a drama, action, and if you want suspense, thriller then you must see this movie.",Positive
481,"There is no reason or point to watch the first half. Movie can directly start from the 2nd half.The pace of the film rises too fast in the 2nd half. This literally creates confusion in plot.The direction and BGM is far better in KGF.Being a pan-India and a broad film, the director must spend some time on VFX works. The VFX is too poor in some sequences, which will not make a quality film. Actors did a great work, the presence of PRABHAS filled the theatres.A commercial film.I am really waiting for the drama in khansar. The entire drama will be similar to GoT.The overall verdict - Watch it to watch SALAAR 2.",Positive

483,"Neon-drenched action and pulsating music ignite Prashanth Neel's Salaar, but beneath the dazzling surface lies a narrative wasteland. While fleeting moments of potential flicker in supporting performances, the film ultimately stumbles under the weight of its own bombast, failing to connect with audiences on an emotional level.Neel's penchant for spectacle over substance permeates the film. Thundering soundtracks and flamboyant set pieces mask a predictable plot built on overused tropes like ""friends turned enemies."" The narrative, echoing Neel's previous work, feels reheated and lacks the thematic depth and emotional resonance that captivated audiences in KGF.Prabhas, burdened by a stoic script, becomes a passive observer in his own film. His slow-motion walks and unemotional delivery fail to inject depth into the protagonist, leaving viewers struggling to connect with him or his motivations. The supporting cast, however, fares better. Prithviraj and Shriya Reddy deliver nuanced performances, hinting at the complexities their characters could have possessed had the script delved deeper.Action sequences, despite their visual flair, remain emotionally hollow. They roar with bombast but lack the raw power and thematic weight that fueled the fights in KGF. Neel throws spectacle at the screen, but it's like empty confetti - flashy and fleeting, leaving nothing behind but a sense of disappointment.Salaar's greatest sin lies not in its flaws, but in its missed potential. Glimpses of a compelling story, exploring complex relationships and emotional turmoil, flicker briefly before being extinguished by the film's relentless pursuit of spectacle. These fleeting moments serve as a painful reminder of what Salaar could have been, a film that resonated with audiences on a deeper level than mere visual thrills.Ultimately, Salaar is a disappointing detour for Neel.It descends from the raw power of KGF into a hollow spectacle, devoid of the emotional core and thematic depth that made his previous work so impactful. While sparks of potential glimmer in the supporting performances, they're not enough to salvage the overall underwhelming experience. Skip Salaar and revisit KGF for a more fulfilling encounter with Neel's directorial talent.",Positive
484,"The movie is a disappointing example of Telugu cinema's lack of originality. The first half of the movie has no clear story line and confuses the audience. It feels like random video clips are stitched together and the audience has to fill in the gaps. Some parts are so dragged out that the audience loses interest in the point. The second half of the movie is a poor imitation of Game of Thrones, with exaggerated characters and unnecessary violence. Shruthi Hasan's role is irrelevant and perplexing. The movie tries to copy the storyline where the Targaryen children are killed, but with Prabhas' tribe instead. Ultimately I was completely able to relate Prabas to John snow. The directors have wasted a huge budget on a movie that lacks creativity and coherence.",Negative
485,"Great Drama and acting. The first part has that punch that the audience is looking for, and 2nd half is full of drama and action with great storytelling in the background. Characters are clearly defined, and imagination to create the film needs to be greatly appreciated. Dev and vardha are incredible, especially their humor during the action sequence and they carry forward their friendship is the big highlight to the movie. Action sequence and background score is also an other highlight to the movie. A big thank you to the director for his vision and creativity. Eagerly looking forward for the next part of the movie.",Positive
486,"Same old story, bogus action scenes! Just a cheap copy of KGF. After Baahubali I have not seen any good movie from Prabhas. This was too a bore. Too many characters, took so much time for world building. If they were planning to make more movies under this franchise name, they should have focused less in world building and more on story telling. They could have progressed their world building with each new movie. This movie could not escape the shadow of KGF. People loved Yash in KGF and director tried to just copy paste those same things! And Throughout the movie, Prabhas was so expression less, I thought I was watching Arjun Kapoor!",Positive
487,"Action movies have become excessively exaggerated in Indian cinema lately. Prabhas, known for his roles post-Bahubali, seems to be stuck in a rut with repetitive movies where he remains stationary, only altering the planet's rotation. This particular film features a dozen entry scenes, with Prabhas engaging in fights without moving from a single spot, resulting in hundreds of people being chopped down. The movie appears to be heavily inspired by Game of Thrones but executed poorly, mirroring the constant shifts in the storyline.The main lead in the film resembles a mere model, standing stoically and striking poses every 5-10 minutes. The movie lacks substance, presenting a mindless and directionless action spectacle where everything seems to spiral out of control. Unfortunately, there's a sequel on the horizon, much to the dismay of the audience. It's advisable to steer clear of this film at all costs to save yourself from disappointment.",Negative
488,"Do not miss Salaar if you liked the KGF and the Salaar is next level of the KGF in terms of the action and thriller.BGM and the music was cherry on top throughout the action sequence and what a roar of the audience in the cinema when Prabhas used to enter the fighting scene.One of the best action movie of Prabhas till date what I felt, it overdelivered than the trailer and nowhere left the movie in a dilemma.Definitely can be given a try if you like the thriller or action genre.Trailer was much better compared to the movie, and even the first half was pretty much entertaining, but the 2nd half for not bearable and it was boring to the another level.Had quite expectation after the trailer as it seemed pretty entertainment kind of a of movie, however the reality was the wastage of the time and money.Better to watch Salaar instead as Salaar is full action packed movie and KGF kind of thriller and action being witnessed in Salaar.You may save your time and money by skipping Dunki and instead watch Salaar if you like action or thriller or suspense.Do not miss this combo of thriller + suspense + action delivered beautifully in a single pack.",Positive

Salaar managed to give greatest action sequences while giving the best story telling and this movie gave an introduction to the khansaar world and finally prabhas comeback has definately came with salaar with a blockbuster hit. We can say that after bahubali Prashant Neel is the one who utilised prabhas as he should be like S S Rajamouli showed him in chatrapati and bahubali prashanth Neel is the one again to him in salaar.

501,"It is genuinely impressive that Sony managed to make the most mediocre trilogy ever with such an iconic character.In terms of enjoyment, Eddie and Venom continue to be a delightfully fun duo. In this 3rd movie, they are basically on a road trip and that was relatively entertaining for the most part. The final act of the movie was also a pretty enjoyable CGI action fest with some emotional scenes.However, the story and script are still as flat as ever. The narrative feels very half baked with it feeling like a chain of things just randomly happening. Pointless characters that don't add much. Jokes being thrown at you just to see which land. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor characters could have been played by anyone but feels purposely done because they knew fans recognised them from other Marvel projects. The villain Knull looks cool but is just there to be teased for future projects.Overall, it is better than the second film but just on par with the first. It is a mediocre final entry. Sony continues to disappoint with their universe and We all know Venom is coming back somehow. I do worry for Spiderman 4 and hope Sony don't mess that movie in anyway.",Neutral
502,"""Venom: The Last Dance' is a messy buddy road trip in which you must turn your brains off...again.Is it perfect? Nah, far from it. I think there are way too many storylines in here, and the main one got some potential, but it was wasted in typical Sony fashion. The ""Spider-Man 4"" rumors have been blown out of proportion in my opinion, so temper your expectations.The duo between Eddie and Venom is as fun as always. I mean Tom Hardy and the banter between them...I'm sorry, the banter between Hardy and himself is the best part of these movies (Hardy is doing the voice of Venom).The humor is there, but can't say I laughed all that much, beacause most of the jokes are base level childish again. It must be a bit more emotional as a whole, because supposedly is the last time we see Venom (hardly doubt), but it ends up kinda hollow.Knull is there...I guess, but will see how and when they'll use him again...it's Sony after all.It's a popcorn movie that reminds me of the early 2000's comic book movies. The action in the third act is good for the most parts and there are some funny moments here and there. Are there plot holes and some issues with the story? Yes. It's just another ""Turn your brains off"" Sony movie again.There are two credit scenes, first one is kinda important, the second one not so much.",Positive
503,"My relationship with the Venom franchise has been rocky. I have a soft spot for the first one, absolutely loathe the second, and now we come to the trilogy's closer, and thankfully, it's an improvement.Venom: The Last Dance works best when it focuses on Eddie and Venom's story instead of trying to set up the future of the Sonyverse. If you didn't like the previous Venom films, this won't change your mind. It's still messy, but it gets more right than its predecessors.This is easily the campiest and most mature of the bunch. It takes its time with the characters, letting us sit with them instead of rushing into the next action set piece. Still being PG-13 it manages to cram in a lot more gore than its predecessors. The action is inventive, and the humor hits its mark. It also doesn't shy away from getting personal and emotional. Eddie and Venom's relationship has never felt more genuine. I'll admit-I teared up a few times by the end.Some may be disappointed by the potrayal of Knull, but personally, I loved it. He feels like an overlooming threat rather than an one-off villain, and the ""God of Darkness"" gets a Thanos-esque treatment he deserves.Now, don't get me wrong-the movie is still bad, technically speaking-but it's self-aware about that. Instead of being ""bad bad,"" it chooses to be ""fun bad"" and entertain you, and I respect that. Not every movie needs to be great; sometimes being fun is enough.Even with the lows, I have always found a weird sense of comfort with this rendition of Venom. I have found myself caring more for these characters than maybe even the script intended. So I am happy to say that by the end, it does enough to justify this trilogy's existence - and to such an satisfying extent that I'd rather live in a world where the Venom movies exist than one where it doesn't.",Positive
504,"The third installment about the symbiotic anti-hero is a mix of bright moments and disappointments. Tom Hardy once again proves why he is the perfect choice for the role of Eddie Brock/Venom, but even his charismatic performance cannot save the unbalanced ensemble. The film starts off promisingly - with dynamic action and witty dialogue between Eddie and his symbiotic companion. Their relationship is still the best the series has to offer. Hardy brilliantly manages both comedic timing and dramatic moments. The visual effects are impressive in places, especially in the action sequences where Venom shows off his abilities. At other times, however, the CGI feels inadequate and more reminiscent of a video game from the last decade. Some fights are well choreographed, others are a chaotic mix of digital effects. The biggest problem is the script, which tries to be too ambitious. It mixes several storylines, introduces new characters and antagonists, but does not give them enough space to develop. The result is a rushed pace and superficial characters. The film's darker tone is a welcome change, but it often clashes with the comedic elements, creating an unbalanced whole. The film seems unsure whether it wants to be a serious drama or a lighthearted entertainment. Venom: The Last Dance is like a roller coaster - it's ups and downs. For fans of the series, it offers enough fun, but it's hard to call it a significant step forward. This film is like an average song on a great album, but as a whole it doesn't leave a strong impression. Fans will find their own, others may be disappointed.",Positive
505,"Maybe it's just because of my low expectations toward the series but it was just fun to watch. I've already lost hope for the trilogy to have a decent plot but I can say that this one has a better storyline than the second film.CGI was fine, I coudn't find any disturbing point. It was interesting to see the other symbiotes. I think those new symbiotes showed more symbiote-ish action scenes than venom when it comes to the fight ironically.There were a few funny jokes that made me laugh but I didn't really find Eddie's weird obsession for shoes funny, like was it supposed to be funny? Guess it was meant to be humor but well... it was almost tiring.",Neutral
506,"A solid enough send off for this 'Venom' trilogy.'Venom: The Last Dance' is decently amusing and produces enough entertainment with its plot. I didn't personally find it overly funny, though the person a few seats across from me had an absolute blast - never a bad thing seeing people enjoy themselves!Tom Hardy remains the key element of these films, they would be far less enjoyable without his presence. There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor stick out most from the other characters.",Negative

508,"Being Rated R probably would have saved this; I am just saying!This trilogy-capper almost makes me question if I have become more of a movie critic than a movie enjoyer. Then I remembered this is Sony's Spider-Man Universe we are talking about, which gave us films like ""Morbius"" and ""Madame Web."" I nonetheless went in here with an open mind, considering I do not mind the two previous ""Venom"" films that came out. After seeing ""The Last Dance,"" I question whether Sony was trying to set up their universe or give Eddie Brock and Venom the send-off they deserve. I am sadly leaning more toward the former.I should preface this review by telling you what I thought of the other two ""Venom"" films upon rewatch in preparation for this third installment. Those were entertaining yet disappointing superhero films saved by the performance of Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and Venom. The first was innocent enough, with a dull first and more engaging second half, a weak villain in Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake/Riot, exciting action, and Hardy performing nicely. Its sequel, ""Let There Be Carnage,"" surprisingly got better when revisiting it, easily surpassing its predecessor, with Hardy allowed to stretch his comedic abilities with Brock and Venom bickering hilariously. In addition, there is Woody Harrelson's enjoyable performance as Cletus Kasady/Carnage, who manages to rise above the flaws, including the disappointing inclusion of Naomie Harris' Frances Barrison/Shriek. Hardy was allowed to have fun with his characters, and the movies complimented him with a narrative that was not too complicated. The opposite is true for ""The Last Dance.""Let's get the positives out of the way first. It is a short list, which I am deeply saddened by, but I want to show you how it is not the worst superhero film out there or even the worst film of the year.Despite a woeful screenplay, Tom Hardy still does skillfully with Eddie Brock and Venom. He is not allowed to have as much fun as he did in the prior two films, but he is trying his best (right, the positives. Sorry).The rest of the cast delivered equally solid performances, with the other standout being Chiwetel Ejiofor as Orwell Taylor. Ejiofor always has a commanding presence whenever he is in a movie, with his characters of Baron Mordo in the two ""Doctor Strange"" films and Bathurst 2020 in the forgettable ""Infinite"" being the two I can think of at the top of my head. Even if the film is not the best, Ejiofor makes it work, and if it is fantastic, he always steals the show.The visual effects bring Venom and the other alien characters to gorgeous life. The other two ""Venom"" movies, granted, had remarkable CGI, but it is worth mentioning, specifically when discussing the positives.The action is somewhat fun. The ""Venom"" movies have always had enjoyable action. Unfortunately, ""The Last Dance"" was the least fun action-wise, but the first scene with action was sweet.The Venom symbiote is sometimes uniquely utilized. The trailers showcased Venom controlling a horse, and in the film, it is one of its best scenes. I am unsure if this is a spoiler, but he controls other animals, and they introduce other symbiotes, which is fun.I think that is it for the positives.I felt the portrayal of Eddie Brock and Venom this time was not good. Again, Hardy tried, but there were multiple times when it felt like he was bored. His character was, admittedly, bored at intervals, and Hardy is a screenwriter, but I am saying how it felt.The film tries to add new characters, but they are not compelling. The most obvious example is Dr. Payne, played by Juno Temple, who does nothing aside from believing that Brock is not a danger, while Ejiofor wants what is best for the world, considering the alien threat from Knull.Speaking of Knull, he was worse than Carlton Drake. He only sends alien minions to grab a MacGuffin that Venom has. I have not read the comics, but the impression I get from others and this movie is that Knull has a profound lore not represented here. Having Knull's alien pals and the Area 51 agents as the villains is too much, yet somehow too little.They also wasted Stephen Graham's Detective Mulligan. The trailers made it seem like Mulligan would be a principal and intriguing character. The only two interesting aspects about Mulligan are he has a symbiote and warns of Knull. That is it.Furthermore, it does not have that much comedy. ""Let There Be Carnage"" can easily be classified as a comedy, and I laughed more than I would like to admit. I think two laughs and three to five chuckles were all I had here. The film was not funny outside of the Venom horse and some banter between Brock and Venom.On top of that, there was not that much emotion. It is due to how much Brock and Venom were not well utilized and the clutter of characters. I did not care about the Area 51 personnel nor the unnamed family who brought Brock and Venom to Vegas. When the ending came along, which heightened the stakes to an unbelievable degree, I did not get emotional. It tried, but it failed to work.The other two ""Venom"" movies were entertaining, but this failed to come close. In an era where ""superhero fatigue"" is becoming more accepted, this trilogy-closer did not try anything new. Fascinating concepts here and there, and many standout scenes fail to save this disappointment in a franchise filled with them.Technically, a 6/10. Outside of the plot and the underwhelming screenplay, the visual effects remain exceptional, the actors did great, and the film functions.For the enjoyment score, I wanted to like this film. I had the sneaking suspicion that it might not work, but watching ""Let There Be Carnage"" increase in quality gave me hope. It was no ""Let There Be Carnage"" and is easily the weakest of the trilogy. It had the issues that plagued the likes of ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but does not come close to being as entertaining as them. I am so unhappy that the enjoyment score is a 4/10, but this trilogy deserved a better conclusion. Maybe it will get better when I watch it again, but as it stands, it is best for me to recommend you wait until Netflix or even Disney+.",Positive
509,"This movie was very middle of the road to me. Definitely better than the second one, but not as good as the original.I enjoyed the beginning very much. Nice pace, good story and funny at times. Also the last part was packed with action and it all looked amazing. Only thing I missed was some sort of a climax at the very end.The middle however, I did not care for too much. Some things felt forced, rushed and very unlikely. But as I often say in my reviews: 'It is a fictional, fantasy, action movie so who cares if some things do not add up.'As a whole I enjoyed it very much, Tom Hardy did not disappoint.",Positive
510,"I just don't get it, I thought the 1st Venom was good despite many fans may not have liked it. I'm not a comic fan, so for me it was good that they try to make it as relatable and realistic to just your average movie goer.The 2nd film was cringy and terrible in my opinion because the story didn't make much sense, too much drama, poetry, and bromance. I lost interest after watching that one but the trailer for this film looked good.Right from the beginning I realize this was going to be bad. I don't care about the multi-verse, I don't care about Knull, I don't care about all these comic lores. The story is completely unrelatable and the suspension of disbelief failed early on.And then to top it off, the ending was just awful.4/10 for the special effects. Everything else is a 0.",Negative
511,"If you've already come to terms with this version of Venom and Eddie Brock as more of a bromance than the savage, brutal duo from the comics, you're in for a fun ride, Venom: The Last Dance, the final chapter of the trilogy, delivers an entertaining ride with solid pacing, good performances, decent visual effects, and fun engaging enough story, added also with the joy of let all the madness fan service out makes Venom: The Last Dance an easy good time especially for me, even the serious part mostly with Chiwetel Ejiofor was executed pretty well, surprising wholesome moments with Rhys Ifans and his family characters, flawed? Sure, some of the editing cuts didn't quite work for me, there were a few cheesy, awkward moments that felt off, and nit picky here and there, overall, i have a good time with Venom: The Last Dance, and the most surprising thing also the least thing i could expect watching this supposed to be last time we'll see both Venom and Eddie was that i did get quite emotional at the end, it's clear they've evolved from mere host and symbiote to something much deeper, and their dynamic was surprisingly touching, my personal experience with these two also comes as long as these three movies together, and as the movie itself whether it's better than the first one which also a good movie in my opinion, The Last Dance succeeded my expectation from being far from bad, i want this goodbye to be at least watchable enough, and the result is more than that, Venom: The Last Dance is actually a good film, just like Venom would say, We are Venom, and this film makes sure we feel it.",Negative
512,"Fun, wild, and hot mess. There's too much plot that's never explained. Events just happen randomly with no payoff, with a big action scene towards the end. Eddie & Venom Bromance is the savior of this trilogy. If you enjoy the others you will enjoy this.Synopsis:
In Venom: The Last Dance, Tom Hardy returns as Venom, one of Marvel's greatest and most complex characters, for the final film in the trilogy. Eddie and Venom are on the run. Hunted by both of their worlds and with the net closing in, the duo are forced into a devastating decision that will bring the curtains down on Venom and Eddie's last dance.",Positive
513,"If you were hoping for a grand finale to the Venom franchise that would surpass the comedic heights of its predecessors, you're in for a letdown. While Venom: The Last Dance does deliver on the comedic front, it falls short in nearly every other aspect.The film picks up right where we left off, with Eddie Brock and Venom still on the run. The plot takes a convoluted turn as they become embroiled in a government conspiracy involving symbiotes and a dangerous threat to the universe. While the premise is intriguing, the execution feels rushed and often confusing.The real draw of this film, as with its predecessors, is the chemistry between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom. Their banter and witty exchanges provide much-needed humor and keep the film entertaining. However, the comedic elements can feel forced at times, and the overall tone can be uneven.The film's biggest flaw is its reliance on poor CGI and even worse dialogue. The visual effects, particularly those involving the titular symbiote, often feel like a step back from previous entries. Venom's appearances are fleeting, and when he does appear in full form, he's often overshadowed by lackluster animation.The script is equally disappointing. The story lacks depth and originality, and the characters feel one-dimensional. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the pacing feels uneven. While there are a few moments of humor that might elicit a chuckle, they're not enough to salvage the film.Ultimately, Venom: The Last Dance is a missed opportunity. It's a shame that such a potentially fun franchise has ended on such a sour note.",Negative
514,"If cinematic catastrophes could have a mascot, this would be standing at the front of the line, waving its tattered flag of mediocrity. Tom Hardy's final outing as Eddie Brock/Venom is not just a disappointment-it's an insult to audiences everywhere. To call this movie bad would be a kindness. This is an incoherent, muddled, and utterly joyless mess that somehow manages to fall short of even the lowest expectations.The premise of Eddie and Venom being ""on the run"" from both worlds promised at least some thrilling action. Instead, what we get is a chaotic, poorly-scripted nightmare of disjointed scenes and absurd plot holes big enough to swallow the entire Marvel universe. The narrative, if you can call it that, lurches forward with all the grace of a drunken man stumbling in the dark. There is no rhyme or reason to the events that unfold. It's like the writers cobbled together every half-baked idea they could think of and hoped nobody would notice how little sense any of it makes.The so-called ""devastating decision"" that Eddie and Venom face feels less like a culmination of their journey and more like a cheap, hollow ploy to yank on the audience's emotions. But even that attempt falls flat because, by the time it arrives, the viewer is too exhausted from enduring 90 minutes of mindless drivel to care.Eddie Brock, once a complex and conflicted anti-hero from the source comics, is reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self, mumbling and stumbling through the film like he just wants to get it over with.The supporting characters are even worse-if that's possible. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use cardboard cutouts of side characters nobody cares about and clearly has no understanding of what made the earlier films (barely) work.They serve no purpose other than to waste screen time and remind us that, yes, someone actually wrote this drivel down on paper.It wouldn't be a Venom movie without over-the-top CGI battles, right? Well, unfortunately, the action scenes here are so poorly executed and short to save cost that even those who came purely for mindless entertainment will leave disappointed. The special effects are a headache-inducing blur of dark, indistinguishable shapes smashing into each other, with zero sense of tension or creativity.The final fight scene feels like -an unintelligible swirl of chaos that is supposed to distract us from the fact that nothing of consequence is happening. It's not exciting, it's not entertaining, it's just ugly.At its core it tries to sell itself as a dramatic, emotional farewell to Eddie and Venom's bond, but it doesn't even come close to achieving that. Any attempt at emotional weight is drowned by the film's clumsy pacing and complete lack of character development. The so-called ""devastating"" decision feels unearned, forced, and utterly unconvincing. There is no sense of closure, no satisfying payoff-just a hollow, empty finale that leaves you wondering why you wasted your time in the first place.Avoid this movie like the symbiote plague it is. Eddie and Venom deserved better. We all deserved better.Tom's ego and nepotism to promote his FWB director both of whom had sole credit of writing the script should tell you that how much he actually despises the franchise.Tom was the ultimate culprit is giving the first movie it's comic tone and had heated arguments with Ruben Flesicher on set to such an extent that filming halted for a few days. There were 3 script writers on the first movie can you guess who was one of them?It's the director of this movie who with her relationship strong armed and hijacked the plot elements and forced to introduce the comic tone into the first movie by reshooting the movie which had resulted in a disjointed mess.Even the Ruben had expressed his deep regrets about that but I guess if you can control the leading star you can have your way.If you closely look at the tone of the first movie first trailer you will notice the horror and science fiction elements present which had been stripped down to barebones and gag and quips reigned supreme.",Negative
515,"My wife and I watched Venom: The Last Dance (2024) last night in theaters. The storyline follows Eddie Brock, who is on the run from the law and hiding in Mexico. When an invasion from Venom's home world begins, Eddie must make his way to Area 51 to find reinforcements and fight off the invaders.Directed by Kelly Marcel in her directorial debut, the film stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Rhys Ifans (The Amazing Spider-Man), Stephen Graham (Snatch), and Juno Temple (Killer Joe).I absolutely loved the first two-thirds of this film. Tom Hardy nailed his role, bringing a perfect blend of humor, action, and Venom's signature appetite for chaos. The various forms Venom takes are visually entertaining, and the self-deprecating humor is spot-on. We especially enjoyed the introduction of a quirky ""hippie family,"" who added a fun twist. However, once the story shifts to Area 51, things feel rushed and forced. The other symbiotes look incredible, but they come and go so quickly that you're left wanting more. The villain's defeat also felt underwhelming, and I wanted a bit more depth in their storyline. The homage at the end felt somewhat awkward as well.In conclusion, Venom: The Last Dance is a fun watch and definitely worth seeing for fans of the character, though it doesn't quite reach its full potential. I'd rate it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Positive

517,"Venom 3 is fun movie. It will never be critically rated, but it doesn't need or try to be. It is fun, it is weird, it looks good and the interactions between Eddie and Venom are great as always and are funny unlike the forced jokes that don't always land. We get to see a bit more of the rest of the symbiotes, but it is not a major focus of the movie to introduce or highlight them, which was a bit disappointing personally. The storyline is a bit messy, and there are a few plotholes and illogical, unexplainable events, but the movie does a good job of actually taking the viewers through it. We get and ending to the trilogy that is pretty much what you expect, but the emotional charge of it feels a bit forced and doesn't let the viewer appreciate it for themselves. We also get a glimpse of what may come in the future, including a namedrop that comic fans will get, so we may see more of our goofy antihero in the future.",Positive
518,"Venom The Last Dance was hilarious, emotional and entertaining. Went in with the same expectations as before very low. I'm shocked about the critics, cause they expected much more unreal scenarios. Here again Sony is not stupid of course they'd have added a specific character in their world, but they probably can't because of a certain contract clause. The third movie is much better than the second cause the second movie suffered from extreme cuts which took out all its potential. Despite the fact that Venom was rumored and in productions ever since early 00s it's no wonder they made a trilogy and had box office success, cause Tom Hardy carried those movies on his own. Every other actor wouldn't be able to pull out this great chemistry between him and Venom. I'm not biased I see its flaws and weaknesses, but my God some critics thrashed this movie as if it's another Morbius or Madame Web. It's by far a better movie.The road trip family was adorable not necessary but there to add a more family atmosphere and emotional touch to this film. Juno Temple was good but underperformed and here background story was dragged into this movie.Ms Cheng was probably the best positive highlight of the movie besides the love for dogs and animals in general.A lot of great symbionts and designs were actually great to watch. I can't say much more to that point cause I want to avoid spoilers.The issuesThe plot and goal of the movie is clear but gets lost through the movie. The action sequences and CGI were average at best. I know that sounds awful for a higher rating, but hear me out. The cast was decent and some actors really shined here.Another problem is the camera work here too many fast cuts hardly to see specially when I think I was obligated to watch it in 3D. I prefer 2D.The biggest problem was there is no clear 1 v 1 villain here with heart and intentions. We have Knull as the big bad in the background but barely seen but only to bait us fans to watch it and another mystery character from the army or swat like crew not shown at all. Where as the first two movies had clear antagonists shown.Issue / or averageThe Ending was emotional and impactful with rushed bangs, but man there were some scenes I really felt touched by it. I still think they could've done more and Tom deserved more !I give it 6 but as a trilogy part and the Tom Hardy factor a light 7, cause reviews between 1-4 stars are harsh. And yeah don't leave there are two important post credit scenes. I'm really looking forward !",Positive

520,"Barely emotional. Barely funny. Barely mediocre. From this pattern, it can be deducted that Venom: The Last Dance is a passable movie that doesn't do enough right to feel like an epic send off, or do anything inherently wrong to be worth complaining about. It's just fine.Tom Hardy is once again the easy stand-out as Eddie Brock, using the same janky physical actions as Venom manipulates his movements to an entertaining degree. The humour is the same safe but fine lines of dialogue that either evoke a chuckle or short exhale of breath. The action scenes escalate in levels of excitement throughout the film, with the final act especially delivering some really fun mayhem. And being the supposed final film of the trilogy, there are some surprisingly tender moments sprinkled in, but aren't frequent enough to draw any real emotion.As aforementioned, the humour is fine but there's one particular segment of the film in Las Vegas that feels too ridiculous and reckless in the context of the movie. Moreover, the story sets up rules that either get contradicted, forgotten, or straight up ignored for the sake of 'cool' scenes. Aside from Eddie and Venom, the rest of the cast of characters come off as either underutilised, underdeveloped, or unnecessary. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rhys Ifans feel criminally wasted, Juno Temple and Clark Backo undermine each other as their characters could've been just compiled into one due to their similar traits, and Stephen Graham and Peggy Lu don't do much to feel properly utilised, especially Graham, who's character felt like was building up to a bigger pay-off than what we got. And the antagonist Knull was so sidelined that there's not much more to say about him other than 'he was in the movie'.In conclusion, for what Venom: The Last Dance can't deliver in a concise plot or compelling side characters, it manages to make up for it with fun symbiote action and mostly entertaining and semi-heartfelt sequences.",Negative
521,"Sony should publicly apologise to the audience for making this worst movie and make the audience suffer and wasted their time. So boring story, nothing to appreciate only actor (Tom Hardy) has done, good acting Else, everyone, not done anything to discuss, that's why am giving one star.Don't waste your money by going into the theatres. CGI was good, but story was so pathetic. You can just guess the whole picture by trailer waste of money. Tom Hardy should try superhero movies with other Studios sony is not good with superheroes. We have already seen this with Superman. Middle part was so boring and ending was too predictable.",Negative
522,"Venom: The Last Dance delivers exactly what it promises-an absurdly fun, high-octane ride with a surprising amount of heart. If you expected Avengers: Endgame level of finality, you walked into the wrong theater, but for those who wanted a dumb but entertaining alien-human bromance, this one's for you.This film is easily the best in the trilogy, blending sharp pacing, humor that actually lands, and action sequences that never feel forced. The weird yet charming dynamic between Eddie and Venom is in full swing, and the filmmakers know exactly how to tap into the ridiculous yet endearing relationship that has become the backbone of this series. It's self-aware without feeling desperate for laughs, striking a balance that's tough to nail in superhero movies these days.While some of the gore pushes the limits of PG-13, it's never gratuitous. There's enough bite to the violence to keep you hooked, but it stops short of being overwhelming. If anything, it adds a little edge to an otherwise slick, polished blockbuster.But the real kicker here is that, amidst all the chaos, Venom: The Last Dance sneaks in some genuine emotion. It's a film about keeping your best bro close, and somehow that works. So why all the hate? It's a popcorn flick that knows exactly what it is, and honestly, that's rare these days.",Positive
523,Almost the whole cast was full. The only cast members that helped was the family and of course the store lady. Mulligan was boring . I felt there was a power struggle when writing this. One wanted to show ase strong women yet made them look stupied and to emotional; while the other smart men but utterly useless in the long run causing more havoc and not thinking before moving.The CGI are as ok. The one creatures could have been way way more creative for sure.Over all it's a lack luster film unfortunately 😕..there's so much they could have done with Tom and this story line. We needed a version of him and Spider man yet have been robbed of that.,Negative
524,"First and foremost, it felt like the makers made every poor decision possible when it came to the sound tracks and music. That which is supposed to amplify the intensity of ride simply let it remain bland throughout, even the climax, even the falling action.With Venom and Eddie having largely ceased their bickering, their bromance has dwindled significantly in this movie. Being the conclusional piece of this hilarious trilogy, it has fallen short of many expectations.Of course there was some of those promised action as witnessed in the trailers. But was there something which swept me off my feet which was absent from the trailers? Not really.While the villain's back-story is rather solid, it could have been more centre-stage. Most of the characters that have made appearance in this movie felt weakly woven together; though the plot could not have moved forward without their roles, they barely left any impact. Speaking of the plot, it largely remains uneventful, with the makers just throwing a few name-sake 3D effect villainous creatures at our faces. There is only one major action sequence throughout the film, that it low-key has bottled down to something I would either skim through, or watch at a slightly increased playback speed.If the unnecessary scenes, and by that I mean, 'adding no humor or value to the plot' scenes were deleted, it could easily boil down to half its current run-time. That being said, there could definitely be leads from where this movie has left loose ends at, but presently, it stays far aloof from being involved in such a gifting.I feel like the last of the trilogy has not done justice to the previous two movies, it almost feels like watching a different character. The ending in particular came off to me as a tryhard terrific ending, and even if the clips were good, the track choices really did not work out for me.",Negative
525,"Eddie and Venom are on the run as fugitives after their battle with Carnage. They are chased by military force and aliens that want to capture them for their codex to unleash a greater evil in their world. Eddie and Venom venture out for a while avoiding authorities and the alien species.I am a fan of the first Venom movie. It is not a well-made movie, but it is so entertaining because of Tom Hardy's crazy performance in both roles and the wacky humor throughout the film. The second movie is much better made mainly because of Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris, but I actually enjoyed the first one more on a fun level. I was pretty excited for the third film and the trailers had me hooked. Does this trilogy end on a memorable last dance?I have mixed thoughts on Venom: The Last Dance. Let's start with the good. I love Eddie and Venom's dynamic and they are at their best in this movie. They have fun chemistry and banter and it feels like they are finally starting to get along with each other a bit better. They also have a few emotional moments that can come off as cheesy, but they have charm especially one scene where Eddie reassures Martin's son that his alien friend is there to help and Venom thanks the kid for a piece of chocolate. In a movie filled with silly moments and action-packed battles, it is a really sweet moment that shows how heroic Eddie and Venom have become.It helps that Tom Hardy is an absolute joy to watch. Hardy relishes in both of his roles and he never lets up. There are several moments of him doing stuff like going crazy at the slot machine and creating a drink at the bar by himself in a quick way. He also handles the more dramatic scenes very well making the more emotional moments work better than they should have.Also, Venom is a very cool character here. He is funny, his powers are awesome and he does anything to protect Eddie even knowing that if they are both alive the aliens will track them down because they have a codex. Venom's antics are very endearing and it seems like he just wants to join the fun and even tries to get Eddie to join in. I love watching him take control of other animals such as a horse, a fish and a frog. Venom is so much fun to watch and he is a good reason why I enjoy these movies despite their faults.The humor is for the most part pretty good. There is one gag that I cringed at but other than that, I got several laughs out of this movie. The banter between Eddie and Venom never gets old for me.The action scenes are pretty entertaining. The chase scene in the river is a standout because it looks cool, it has Eddie Brock defend himself without Venom and Venom turning into other creatures. It is also frenetic and fun to see play out. The climax is also big full of cool moments, but it is a little CGI heavy. However, it features Venom on a motorcycle again and it looks great. Overall, I enjoyed the action.The cinematography by Fabian Wagner is solid and colorful. The lighting is also on point with all of the scenes being lit well enough to see while having some flare in the shots. This is by far the best looking Venom movie filmmaking wise. The special effects are more polished and the alien creatures chasing Venom and Eddie look very menacing. Honestly, they kind of remind me of the Kaijus from Pacific Rim and I like that. There also other symbiotes in the film and they look very cool with their designs, but some of their colors blend in. The visuals are not perfect, but they are an upgrade from the last two movies.All that said, there are a few problems I have with this movie. The biggest problem is that the script is overstuffed. I know that there needs to other plot lines to have the story come together, but some of them do not work at all. The scientists subplot is one of the most boring parts of the movie with how slowly paced it is and how the tone shifts from fun to dreary and not the good kind of dreary. The subplot with Martin and his family is okay and has some great moments, but it can drag a little too long.The supporting cast does not hold a candle to Tom Hardy. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Rex Strickland is the best supporting performance, but his character is too unlikable to root for. Dr. Payne is kind of there until the climax. Clark Backo as Sadie Christmas is alright and she does a lot in the climax, but her character does not stand out until then. Rhys Ifans is having a lot of fun in his role as a family man who believes in aliens. While his family may have gotten a little more focus than they should have, Ifans is pretty fun to watch at times. Andy Serkis as Knull is absolutely wasted. He seems like a menacing villain, but he gets little to do aside from getting expository dialogue. By far, the weakest link in the film and wastes Andy Serkis on a limited role.The tone is all over the place. There are moments where this movie acts like a cheesy road trip comedy with Eddie and Venom and then the next scene could be overly serious research about the symbiotes. The movie progressively darker as it goes along and it has some moments that should come off as emotional and while they kind of work because of Tom Hardy's performance and the duo's likability, they feel a bit unearned because of how comedic this series is by now. When Eddie and Venom ponder the life they could have had when in the car with Martin's family, it is hard to feel anything because they have been two goofballs most of the time. Without spoiling anything, ending is a mixed bag for me because it is sad, but not a tearjerker like the movie wants it to be.The musical score by Dan Deacon makes no impression on me. It just sounds like generic music from any other movie. The needle drops are okay, but I wish they could find another song than Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. However, the credits song One Last Dance by Tom and Roman Morello and Grandson is really catchy and a great song to end the movie. Also, Maroon 5's Memories has a great needle drop here.Venom: The Last Dance is an entertaining movie. It is not well-made and not even as fun as the first film, but I overall had a pretty good time with the movie despite the many issues it has. I guess I cannot help but find Eddie and Venom a lot of fun to watch. Director Kelly Marcel did a great job with the scenes with those two and with the action scenes, but I think she bit off more than she could chew with the other subplots. If you like the Venom movies, you will probably enjoy this movie but if you never them then this movie will not change your mind.Stay through all of the credits.",Positive
526,"It is genuinely impressive that Sony managed to make the most mediocre trilogy ever with such an iconic character.In terms of enjoyment, Eddie and Venom continue to be a delightfully fun duo. In this 3rd movie, they are basically on a road trip and that was relatively entertaining for the most part. The final act of the movie was also a pretty enjoyable CGI action fest with some emotional scenes.However, the story and script are still as flat as ever. The narrative feels very half baked with it feeling like a chain of things just randomly happening. Pointless characters that don't add much. Jokes being thrown at you just to see which land. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor characters could have been played by anyone but feels purposely done because they knew fans recognised them from other Marvel projects. The villain Knull looks cool but is just there to be teased for future projects.Overall, it is better than the second film but just on par with the first. It is a mediocre final entry. Sony continues to disappoint with their universe and We all know Venom is coming back somehow. I do worry for Spiderman 4 and hope Sony don't mess that movie in anyway.",Neutral
527,"""Venom: The Last Dance' is a messy buddy road trip in which you must turn your brains off...again.Is it perfect? Nah, far from it. I think there are way too many storylines in here, and the main one got some potential, but it was wasted in typical Sony fashion. The ""Spider-Man 4"" rumors have been blown out of proportion in my opinion, so temper your expectations.The duo between Eddie and Venom is as fun as always. I mean Tom Hardy and the banter between them...I'm sorry, the banter between Hardy and himself is the best part of these movies (Hardy is doing the voice of Venom).The humor is there, but can't say I laughed all that much, beacause most of the jokes are base level childish again. It must be a bit more emotional as a whole, because supposedly is the last time we see Venom (hardly doubt), but it ends up kinda hollow.Knull is there...I guess, but will see how and when they'll use him again...it's Sony after all.It's a popcorn movie that reminds me of the early 2000's comic book movies. The action in the third act is good for the most parts and there are some funny moments here and there. Are there plot holes and some issues with the story? Yes. It's just another ""Turn your brains off"" Sony movie again.There are two credit scenes, first one is kinda important, the second one not so much.",Positive
528,"My relationship with the Venom franchise has been rocky. I have a soft spot for the first one, absolutely loathe the second, and now we come to the trilogy's closer, and thankfully, it's an improvement.Venom: The Last Dance works best when it focuses on Eddie and Venom's story instead of trying to set up the future of the Sonyverse. If you didn't like the previous Venom films, this won't change your mind. It's still messy, but it gets more right than its predecessors.This is easily the campiest and most mature of the bunch. It takes its time with the characters, letting us sit with them instead of rushing into the next action set piece. Still being PG-13 it manages to cram in a lot more gore than its predecessors. The action is inventive, and the humor hits its mark. It also doesn't shy away from getting personal and emotional. Eddie and Venom's relationship has never felt more genuine. I'll admit-I teared up a few times by the end.Some may be disappointed by the potrayal of Knull, but personally, I loved it. He feels like an overlooming threat rather than an one-off villain, and the ""God of Darkness"" gets a Thanos-esque treatment he deserves.Now, don't get me wrong-the movie is still bad, technically speaking-but it's self-aware about that. Instead of being ""bad bad,"" it chooses to be ""fun bad"" and entertain you, and I respect that. Not every movie needs to be great; sometimes being fun is enough.Even with the lows, I have always found a weird sense of comfort with this rendition of Venom. I have found myself caring more for these characters than maybe even the script intended. So I am happy to say that by the end, it does enough to justify this trilogy's existence - and to such an satisfying extent that I'd rather live in a world where the Venom movies exist than one where it doesn't.",Positive
529,"The third installment about the symbiotic anti-hero is a mix of bright moments and disappointments. Tom Hardy once again proves why he is the perfect choice for the role of Eddie Brock/Venom, but even his charismatic performance cannot save the unbalanced ensemble. The film starts off promisingly - with dynamic action and witty dialogue between Eddie and his symbiotic companion. Their relationship is still the best the series has to offer. Hardy brilliantly manages both comedic timing and dramatic moments. The visual effects are impressive in places, especially in the action sequences where Venom shows off his abilities. At other times, however, the CGI feels inadequate and more reminiscent of a video game from the last decade. Some fights are well choreographed, others are a chaotic mix of digital effects. The biggest problem is the script, which tries to be too ambitious. It mixes several storylines, introduces new characters and antagonists, but does not give them enough space to develop. The result is a rushed pace and superficial characters. The film's darker tone is a welcome change, but it often clashes with the comedic elements, creating an unbalanced whole. The film seems unsure whether it wants to be a serious drama or a lighthearted entertainment. Venom: The Last Dance is like a roller coaster - it's ups and downs. For fans of the series, it offers enough fun, but it's hard to call it a significant step forward. This film is like an average song on a great album, but as a whole it doesn't leave a strong impression. Fans will find their own, others may be disappointed.",Positive
530,"Maybe it's just because of my low expectations toward the series but it was just fun to watch. I've already lost hope for the trilogy to have a decent plot but I can say that this one has a better storyline than the second film.CGI was fine, I coudn't find any disturbing point. It was interesting to see the other symbiotes. I think those new symbiotes showed more symbiote-ish action scenes than venom when it comes to the fight ironically.There were a few funny jokes that made me laugh but I didn't really find Eddie's weird obsession for shoes funny, like was it supposed to be funny? Guess it was meant to be humor but well... it was almost tiring.",Neutral
531,"A solid enough send off for this 'Venom' trilogy.'Venom: The Last Dance' is decently amusing and produces enough entertainment with its plot. I didn't personally find it overly funny, though the person a few seats across from me had an absolute blast - never a bad thing seeing people enjoy themselves!Tom Hardy remains the key element of these films, they would be far less enjoyable without his presence. There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor stick out most from the other characters.",Negative

533,"Being Rated R probably would have saved this; I am just saying!This trilogy-capper almost makes me question if I have become more of a movie critic than a movie enjoyer. Then I remembered this is Sony's Spider-Man Universe we are talking about, which gave us films like ""Morbius"" and ""Madame Web."" I nonetheless went in here with an open mind, considering I do not mind the two previous ""Venom"" films that came out. After seeing ""The Last Dance,"" I question whether Sony was trying to set up their universe or give Eddie Brock and Venom the send-off they deserve. I am sadly leaning more toward the former.I should preface this review by telling you what I thought of the other two ""Venom"" films upon rewatch in preparation for this third installment. Those were entertaining yet disappointing superhero films saved by the performance of Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and Venom. The first was innocent enough, with a dull first and more engaging second half, a weak villain in Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake/Riot, exciting action, and Hardy performing nicely. Its sequel, ""Let There Be Carnage,"" surprisingly got better when revisiting it, easily surpassing its predecessor, with Hardy allowed to stretch his comedic abilities with Brock and Venom bickering hilariously. In addition, there is Woody Harrelson's enjoyable performance as Cletus Kasady/Carnage, who manages to rise above the flaws, including the disappointing inclusion of Naomie Harris' Frances Barrison/Shriek. Hardy was allowed to have fun with his characters, and the movies complimented him with a narrative that was not too complicated. The opposite is true for ""The Last Dance.""Let's get the positives out of the way first. It is a short list, which I am deeply saddened by, but I want to show you how it is not the worst superhero film out there or even the worst film of the year.Despite a woeful screenplay, Tom Hardy still does skillfully with Eddie Brock and Venom. He is not allowed to have as much fun as he did in the prior two films, but he is trying his best (right, the positives. Sorry).The rest of the cast delivered equally solid performances, with the other standout being Chiwetel Ejiofor as Orwell Taylor. Ejiofor always has a commanding presence whenever he is in a movie, with his characters of Baron Mordo in the two ""Doctor Strange"" films and Bathurst 2020 in the forgettable ""Infinite"" being the two I can think of at the top of my head. Even if the film is not the best, Ejiofor makes it work, and if it is fantastic, he always steals the show.The visual effects bring Venom and the other alien characters to gorgeous life. The other two ""Venom"" movies, granted, had remarkable CGI, but it is worth mentioning, specifically when discussing the positives.The action is somewhat fun. The ""Venom"" movies have always had enjoyable action. Unfortunately, ""The Last Dance"" was the least fun action-wise, but the first scene with action was sweet.The Venom symbiote is sometimes uniquely utilized. The trailers showcased Venom controlling a horse, and in the film, it is one of its best scenes. I am unsure if this is a spoiler, but he controls other animals, and they introduce other symbiotes, which is fun.I think that is it for the positives.I felt the portrayal of Eddie Brock and Venom this time was not good. Again, Hardy tried, but there were multiple times when it felt like he was bored. His character was, admittedly, bored at intervals, and Hardy is a screenwriter, but I am saying how it felt.The film tries to add new characters, but they are not compelling. The most obvious example is Dr. Payne, played by Juno Temple, who does nothing aside from believing that Brock is not a danger, while Ejiofor wants what is best for the world, considering the alien threat from Knull.Speaking of Knull, he was worse than Carlton Drake. He only sends alien minions to grab a MacGuffin that Venom has. I have not read the comics, but the impression I get from others and this movie is that Knull has a profound lore not represented here. Having Knull's alien pals and the Area 51 agents as the villains is too much, yet somehow too little.They also wasted Stephen Graham's Detective Mulligan. The trailers made it seem like Mulligan would be a principal and intriguing character. The only two interesting aspects about Mulligan are he has a symbiote and warns of Knull. That is it.Furthermore, it does not have that much comedy. ""Let There Be Carnage"" can easily be classified as a comedy, and I laughed more than I would like to admit. I think two laughs and three to five chuckles were all I had here. The film was not funny outside of the Venom horse and some banter between Brock and Venom.On top of that, there was not that much emotion. It is due to how much Brock and Venom were not well utilized and the clutter of characters. I did not care about the Area 51 personnel nor the unnamed family who brought Brock and Venom to Vegas. When the ending came along, which heightened the stakes to an unbelievable degree, I did not get emotional. It tried, but it failed to work.The other two ""Venom"" movies were entertaining, but this failed to come close. In an era where ""superhero fatigue"" is becoming more accepted, this trilogy-closer did not try anything new. Fascinating concepts here and there, and many standout scenes fail to save this disappointment in a franchise filled with them.Technically, a 6/10. Outside of the plot and the underwhelming screenplay, the visual effects remain exceptional, the actors did great, and the film functions.For the enjoyment score, I wanted to like this film. I had the sneaking suspicion that it might not work, but watching ""Let There Be Carnage"" increase in quality gave me hope. It was no ""Let There Be Carnage"" and is easily the weakest of the trilogy. It had the issues that plagued the likes of ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but does not come close to being as entertaining as them. I am so unhappy that the enjoyment score is a 4/10, but this trilogy deserved a better conclusion. Maybe it will get better when I watch it again, but as it stands, it is best for me to recommend you wait until Netflix or even Disney+.",Positive
534,"This movie was very middle of the road to me. Definitely better than the second one, but not as good as the original.I enjoyed the beginning very much. Nice pace, good story and funny at times. Also the last part was packed with action and it all looked amazing. Only thing I missed was some sort of a climax at the very end.The middle however, I did not care for too much. Some things felt forced, rushed and very unlikely. But as I often say in my reviews: 'It is a fictional, fantasy, action movie so who cares if some things do not add up.'As a whole I enjoyed it very much, Tom Hardy did not disappoint.",Positive
535,"I just don't get it, I thought the 1st Venom was good despite many fans may not have liked it. I'm not a comic fan, so for me it was good that they try to make it as relatable and realistic to just your average movie goer.The 2nd film was cringy and terrible in my opinion because the story didn't make much sense, too much drama, poetry, and bromance. I lost interest after watching that one but the trailer for this film looked good.Right from the beginning I realize this was going to be bad. I don't care about the multi-verse, I don't care about Knull, I don't care about all these comic lores. The story is completely unrelatable and the suspension of disbelief failed early on.And then to top it off, the ending was just awful.4/10 for the special effects. Everything else is a 0.",Negative
536,"If you've already come to terms with this version of Venom and Eddie Brock as more of a bromance than the savage, brutal duo from the comics, you're in for a fun ride, Venom: The Last Dance, the final chapter of the trilogy, delivers an entertaining ride with solid pacing, good performances, decent visual effects, and fun engaging enough story, added also with the joy of let all the madness fan service out makes Venom: The Last Dance an easy good time especially for me, even the serious part mostly with Chiwetel Ejiofor was executed pretty well, surprising wholesome moments with Rhys Ifans and his family characters, flawed? Sure, some of the editing cuts didn't quite work for me, there were a few cheesy, awkward moments that felt off, and nit picky here and there, overall, i have a good time with Venom: The Last Dance, and the most surprising thing also the least thing i could expect watching this supposed to be last time we'll see both Venom and Eddie was that i did get quite emotional at the end, it's clear they've evolved from mere host and symbiote to something much deeper, and their dynamic was surprisingly touching, my personal experience with these two also comes as long as these three movies together, and as the movie itself whether it's better than the first one which also a good movie in my opinion, The Last Dance succeeded my expectation from being far from bad, i want this goodbye to be at least watchable enough, and the result is more than that, Venom: The Last Dance is actually a good film, just like Venom would say, We are Venom, and this film makes sure we feel it.",Negative
537,"Fun, wild, and hot mess. There's too much plot that's never explained. Events just happen randomly with no payoff, with a big action scene towards the end. Eddie & Venom Bromance is the savior of this trilogy. If you enjoy the others you will enjoy this.Synopsis:
In Venom: The Last Dance, Tom Hardy returns as Venom, one of Marvel's greatest and most complex characters, for the final film in the trilogy. Eddie and Venom are on the run. Hunted by both of their worlds and with the net closing in, the duo are forced into a devastating decision that will bring the curtains down on Venom and Eddie's last dance.",Positive
538,"If you were hoping for a grand finale to the Venom franchise that would surpass the comedic heights of its predecessors, you're in for a letdown. While Venom: The Last Dance does deliver on the comedic front, it falls short in nearly every other aspect.The film picks up right where we left off, with Eddie Brock and Venom still on the run. The plot takes a convoluted turn as they become embroiled in a government conspiracy involving symbiotes and a dangerous threat to the universe. While the premise is intriguing, the execution feels rushed and often confusing.The real draw of this film, as with its predecessors, is the chemistry between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom. Their banter and witty exchanges provide much-needed humor and keep the film entertaining. However, the comedic elements can feel forced at times, and the overall tone can be uneven.The film's biggest flaw is its reliance on poor CGI and even worse dialogue. The visual effects, particularly those involving the titular symbiote, often feel like a step back from previous entries. Venom's appearances are fleeting, and when he does appear in full form, he's often overshadowed by lackluster animation.The script is equally disappointing. The story lacks depth and originality, and the characters feel one-dimensional. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the pacing feels uneven. While there are a few moments of humor that might elicit a chuckle, they're not enough to salvage the film.Ultimately, Venom: The Last Dance is a missed opportunity. It's a shame that such a potentially fun franchise has ended on such a sour note.",Negative
539,"If cinematic catastrophes could have a mascot, this would be standing at the front of the line, waving its tattered flag of mediocrity. Tom Hardy's final outing as Eddie Brock/Venom is not just a disappointment-it's an insult to audiences everywhere. To call this movie bad would be a kindness. This is an incoherent, muddled, and utterly joyless mess that somehow manages to fall short of even the lowest expectations.The premise of Eddie and Venom being ""on the run"" from both worlds promised at least some thrilling action. Instead, what we get is a chaotic, poorly-scripted nightmare of disjointed scenes and absurd plot holes big enough to swallow the entire Marvel universe. The narrative, if you can call it that, lurches forward with all the grace of a drunken man stumbling in the dark. There is no rhyme or reason to the events that unfold. It's like the writers cobbled together every half-baked idea they could think of and hoped nobody would notice how little sense any of it makes.The so-called ""devastating decision"" that Eddie and Venom face feels less like a culmination of their journey and more like a cheap, hollow ploy to yank on the audience's emotions. But even that attempt falls flat because, by the time it arrives, the viewer is too exhausted from enduring 90 minutes of mindless drivel to care.Eddie Brock, once a complex and conflicted anti-hero from the source comics, is reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self, mumbling and stumbling through the film like he just wants to get it over with.The supporting characters are even worse-if that's possible. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use cardboard cutouts of side characters nobody cares about and clearly has no understanding of what made the earlier films (barely) work.They serve no purpose other than to waste screen time and remind us that, yes, someone actually wrote this drivel down on paper.It wouldn't be a Venom movie without over-the-top CGI battles, right? Well, unfortunately, the action scenes here are so poorly executed and short to save cost that even those who came purely for mindless entertainment will leave disappointed. The special effects are a headache-inducing blur of dark, indistinguishable shapes smashing into each other, with zero sense of tension or creativity.The final fight scene feels like -an unintelligible swirl of chaos that is supposed to distract us from the fact that nothing of consequence is happening. It's not exciting, it's not entertaining, it's just ugly.At its core it tries to sell itself as a dramatic, emotional farewell to Eddie and Venom's bond, but it doesn't even come close to achieving that. Any attempt at emotional weight is drowned by the film's clumsy pacing and complete lack of character development. The so-called ""devastating"" decision feels unearned, forced, and utterly unconvincing. There is no sense of closure, no satisfying payoff-just a hollow, empty finale that leaves you wondering why you wasted your time in the first place.Avoid this movie like the symbiote plague it is. Eddie and Venom deserved better. We all deserved better.Tom's ego and nepotism to promote his FWB director both of whom had sole credit of writing the script should tell you that how much he actually despises the franchise.Tom was the ultimate culprit is giving the first movie it's comic tone and had heated arguments with Ruben Flesicher on set to such an extent that filming halted for a few days. There were 3 script writers on the first movie can you guess who was one of them?It's the director of this movie who with her relationship strong armed and hijacked the plot elements and forced to introduce the comic tone into the first movie by reshooting the movie which had resulted in a disjointed mess.Even the Ruben had expressed his deep regrets about that but I guess if you can control the leading star you can have your way.If you closely look at the tone of the first movie first trailer you will notice the horror and science fiction elements present which had been stripped down to barebones and gag and quips reigned supreme.",Negative
540,"My wife and I watched Venom: The Last Dance (2024) last night in theaters. The storyline follows Eddie Brock, who is on the run from the law and hiding in Mexico. When an invasion from Venom's home world begins, Eddie must make his way to Area 51 to find reinforcements and fight off the invaders.Directed by Kelly Marcel in her directorial debut, the film stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Rhys Ifans (The Amazing Spider-Man), Stephen Graham (Snatch), and Juno Temple (Killer Joe).I absolutely loved the first two-thirds of this film. Tom Hardy nailed his role, bringing a perfect blend of humor, action, and Venom's signature appetite for chaos. The various forms Venom takes are visually entertaining, and the self-deprecating humor is spot-on. We especially enjoyed the introduction of a quirky ""hippie family,"" who added a fun twist. However, once the story shifts to Area 51, things feel rushed and forced. The other symbiotes look incredible, but they come and go so quickly that you're left wanting more. The villain's defeat also felt underwhelming, and I wanted a bit more depth in their storyline. The homage at the end felt somewhat awkward as well.In conclusion, Venom: The Last Dance is a fun watch and definitely worth seeing for fans of the character, though it doesn't quite reach its full potential. I'd rate it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Positive

542,"Venom 3 is fun movie. It will never be critically rated, but it doesn't need or try to be. It is fun, it is weird, it looks good and the interactions between Eddie and Venom are great as always and are funny unlike the forced jokes that don't always land. We get to see a bit more of the rest of the symbiotes, but it is not a major focus of the movie to introduce or highlight them, which was a bit disappointing personally. The storyline is a bit messy, and there are a few plotholes and illogical, unexplainable events, but the movie does a good job of actually taking the viewers through it. We get and ending to the trilogy that is pretty much what you expect, but the emotional charge of it feels a bit forced and doesn't let the viewer appreciate it for themselves. We also get a glimpse of what may come in the future, including a namedrop that comic fans will get, so we may see more of our goofy antihero in the future.",Positive
543,"Venom The Last Dance was hilarious, emotional and entertaining. Went in with the same expectations as before very low. I'm shocked about the critics, cause they expected much more unreal scenarios. Here again Sony is not stupid of course they'd have added a specific character in their world, but they probably can't because of a certain contract clause. The third movie is much better than the second cause the second movie suffered from extreme cuts which took out all its potential. Despite the fact that Venom was rumored and in productions ever since early 00s it's no wonder they made a trilogy and had box office success, cause Tom Hardy carried those movies on his own. Every other actor wouldn't be able to pull out this great chemistry between him and Venom. I'm not biased I see its flaws and weaknesses, but my God some critics thrashed this movie as if it's another Morbius or Madame Web. It's by far a better movie.The road trip family was adorable not necessary but there to add a more family atmosphere and emotional touch to this film. Juno Temple was good but underperformed and here background story was dragged into this movie.Ms Cheng was probably the best positive highlight of the movie besides the love for dogs and animals in general.A lot of great symbionts and designs were actually great to watch. I can't say much more to that point cause I want to avoid spoilers.The issuesThe plot and goal of the movie is clear but gets lost through the movie. The action sequences and CGI were average at best. I know that sounds awful for a higher rating, but hear me out. The cast was decent and some actors really shined here.Another problem is the camera work here too many fast cuts hardly to see specially when I think I was obligated to watch it in 3D. I prefer 2D.The biggest problem was there is no clear 1 v 1 villain here with heart and intentions. We have Knull as the big bad in the background but barely seen but only to bait us fans to watch it and another mystery character from the army or swat like crew not shown at all. Where as the first two movies had clear antagonists shown.Issue / or averageThe Ending was emotional and impactful with rushed bangs, but man there were some scenes I really felt touched by it. I still think they could've done more and Tom deserved more !I give it 6 but as a trilogy part and the Tom Hardy factor a light 7, cause reviews between 1-4 stars are harsh. And yeah don't leave there are two important post credit scenes. I'm really looking forward !",Positive

545,"Barely emotional. Barely funny. Barely mediocre. From this pattern, it can be deducted that Venom: The Last Dance is a passable movie that doesn't do enough right to feel like an epic send off, or do anything inherently wrong to be worth complaining about. It's just fine.Tom Hardy is once again the easy stand-out as Eddie Brock, using the same janky physical actions as Venom manipulates his movements to an entertaining degree. The humour is the same safe but fine lines of dialogue that either evoke a chuckle or short exhale of breath. The action scenes escalate in levels of excitement throughout the film, with the final act especially delivering some really fun mayhem. And being the supposed final film of the trilogy, there are some surprisingly tender moments sprinkled in, but aren't frequent enough to draw any real emotion.As aforementioned, the humour is fine but there's one particular segment of the film in Las Vegas that feels too ridiculous and reckless in the context of the movie. Moreover, the story sets up rules that either get contradicted, forgotten, or straight up ignored for the sake of 'cool' scenes. Aside from Eddie and Venom, the rest of the cast of characters come off as either underutilised, underdeveloped, or unnecessary. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rhys Ifans feel criminally wasted, Juno Temple and Clark Backo undermine each other as their characters could've been just compiled into one due to their similar traits, and Stephen Graham and Peggy Lu don't do much to feel properly utilised, especially Graham, who's character felt like was building up to a bigger pay-off than what we got. And the antagonist Knull was so sidelined that there's not much more to say about him other than 'he was in the movie'.In conclusion, for what Venom: The Last Dance can't deliver in a concise plot or compelling side characters, it manages to make up for it with fun symbiote action and mostly entertaining and semi-heartfelt sequences.",Negative
546,"Sony should publicly apologise to the audience for making this worst movie and make the audience suffer and wasted their time. So boring story, nothing to appreciate only actor (Tom Hardy) has done, good acting Else, everyone, not done anything to discuss, that's why am giving one star.Don't waste your money by going into the theatres. CGI was good, but story was so pathetic. You can just guess the whole picture by trailer waste of money. Tom Hardy should try superhero movies with other Studios sony is not good with superheroes. We have already seen this with Superman. Middle part was so boring and ending was too predictable.",Negative
547,"Venom: The Last Dance delivers exactly what it promises-an absurdly fun, high-octane ride with a surprising amount of heart. If you expected Avengers: Endgame level of finality, you walked into the wrong theater, but for those who wanted a dumb but entertaining alien-human bromance, this one's for you.This film is easily the best in the trilogy, blending sharp pacing, humor that actually lands, and action sequences that never feel forced. The weird yet charming dynamic between Eddie and Venom is in full swing, and the filmmakers know exactly how to tap into the ridiculous yet endearing relationship that has become the backbone of this series. It's self-aware without feeling desperate for laughs, striking a balance that's tough to nail in superhero movies these days.While some of the gore pushes the limits of PG-13, it's never gratuitous. There's enough bite to the violence to keep you hooked, but it stops short of being overwhelming. If anything, it adds a little edge to an otherwise slick, polished blockbuster.But the real kicker here is that, amidst all the chaos, Venom: The Last Dance sneaks in some genuine emotion. It's a film about keeping your best bro close, and somehow that works. So why all the hate? It's a popcorn flick that knows exactly what it is, and honestly, that's rare these days.",Positive
548,Almost the whole cast was full. The only cast members that helped was the family and of course the store lady. Mulligan was boring . I felt there was a power struggle when writing this. One wanted to show ase strong women yet made them look stupied and to emotional; while the other smart men but utterly useless in the long run causing more havoc and not thinking before moving.The CGI are as ok. The one creatures could have been way way more creative for sure.Over all it's a lack luster film unfortunately 😕..there's so much they could have done with Tom and this story line. We needed a version of him and Spider man yet have been robbed of that.,Negative
549,"First and foremost, it felt like the makers made every poor decision possible when it came to the sound tracks and music. That which is supposed to amplify the intensity of ride simply let it remain bland throughout, even the climax, even the falling action.With Venom and Eddie having largely ceased their bickering, their bromance has dwindled significantly in this movie. Being the conclusional piece of this hilarious trilogy, it has fallen short of many expectations.Of course there was some of those promised action as witnessed in the trailers. But was there something which swept me off my feet which was absent from the trailers? Not really.While the villain's back-story is rather solid, it could have been more centre-stage. Most of the characters that have made appearance in this movie felt weakly woven together; though the plot could not have moved forward without their roles, they barely left any impact. Speaking of the plot, it largely remains uneventful, with the makers just throwing a few name-sake 3D effect villainous creatures at our faces. There is only one major action sequence throughout the film, that it low-key has bottled down to something I would either skim through, or watch at a slightly increased playback speed.If the unnecessary scenes, and by that I mean, 'adding no humor or value to the plot' scenes were deleted, it could easily boil down to half its current run-time. That being said, there could definitely be leads from where this movie has left loose ends at, but presently, it stays far aloof from being involved in such a gifting.I feel like the last of the trilogy has not done justice to the previous two movies, it almost feels like watching a different character. The ending in particular came off to me as a tryhard terrific ending, and even if the clips were good, the track choices really did not work out for me.",Negative
550,"Eddie and Venom are on the run as fugitives after their battle with Carnage. They are chased by military force and aliens that want to capture them for their codex to unleash a greater evil in their world. Eddie and Venom venture out for a while avoiding authorities and the alien species.I am a fan of the first Venom movie. It is not a well-made movie, but it is so entertaining because of Tom Hardy's crazy performance in both roles and the wacky humor throughout the film. The second movie is much better made mainly because of Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris, but I actually enjoyed the first one more on a fun level. I was pretty excited for the third film and the trailers had me hooked. Does this trilogy end on a memorable last dance?I have mixed thoughts on Venom: The Last Dance. Let's start with the good. I love Eddie and Venom's dynamic and they are at their best in this movie. They have fun chemistry and banter and it feels like they are finally starting to get along with each other a bit better. They also have a few emotional moments that can come off as cheesy, but they have charm especially one scene where Eddie reassures Martin's son that his alien friend is there to help and Venom thanks the kid for a piece of chocolate. In a movie filled with silly moments and action-packed battles, it is a really sweet moment that shows how heroic Eddie and Venom have become.It helps that Tom Hardy is an absolute joy to watch. Hardy relishes in both of his roles and he never lets up. There are several moments of him doing stuff like going crazy at the slot machine and creating a drink at the bar by himself in a quick way. He also handles the more dramatic scenes very well making the more emotional moments work better than they should have.Also, Venom is a very cool character here. He is funny, his powers are awesome and he does anything to protect Eddie even knowing that if they are both alive the aliens will track them down because they have a codex. Venom's antics are very endearing and it seems like he just wants to join the fun and even tries to get Eddie to join in. I love watching him take control of other animals such as a horse, a fish and a frog. Venom is so much fun to watch and he is a good reason why I enjoy these movies despite their faults.The humor is for the most part pretty good. There is one gag that I cringed at but other than that, I got several laughs out of this movie. The banter between Eddie and Venom never gets old for me.The action scenes are pretty entertaining. The chase scene in the river is a standout because it looks cool, it has Eddie Brock defend himself without Venom and Venom turning into other creatures. It is also frenetic and fun to see play out. The climax is also big full of cool moments, but it is a little CGI heavy. However, it features Venom on a motorcycle again and it looks great. Overall, I enjoyed the action.The cinematography by Fabian Wagner is solid and colorful. The lighting is also on point with all of the scenes being lit well enough to see while having some flare in the shots. This is by far the best looking Venom movie filmmaking wise. The special effects are more polished and the alien creatures chasing Venom and Eddie look very menacing. Honestly, they kind of remind me of the Kaijus from Pacific Rim and I like that. There also other symbiotes in the film and they look very cool with their designs, but some of their colors blend in. The visuals are not perfect, but they are an upgrade from the last two movies.All that said, there are a few problems I have with this movie. The biggest problem is that the script is overstuffed. I know that there needs to other plot lines to have the story come together, but some of them do not work at all. The scientists subplot is one of the most boring parts of the movie with how slowly paced it is and how the tone shifts from fun to dreary and not the good kind of dreary. The subplot with Martin and his family is okay and has some great moments, but it can drag a little too long.The supporting cast does not hold a candle to Tom Hardy. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Rex Strickland is the best supporting performance, but his character is too unlikable to root for. Dr. Payne is kind of there until the climax. Clark Backo as Sadie Christmas is alright and she does a lot in the climax, but her character does not stand out until then. Rhys Ifans is having a lot of fun in his role as a family man who believes in aliens. While his family may have gotten a little more focus than they should have, Ifans is pretty fun to watch at times. Andy Serkis as Knull is absolutely wasted. He seems like a menacing villain, but he gets little to do aside from getting expository dialogue. By far, the weakest link in the film and wastes Andy Serkis on a limited role.The tone is all over the place. There are moments where this movie acts like a cheesy road trip comedy with Eddie and Venom and then the next scene could be overly serious research about the symbiotes. The movie progressively darker as it goes along and it has some moments that should come off as emotional and while they kind of work because of Tom Hardy's performance and the duo's likability, they feel a bit unearned because of how comedic this series is by now. When Eddie and Venom ponder the life they could have had when in the car with Martin's family, it is hard to feel anything because they have been two goofballs most of the time. Without spoiling anything, ending is a mixed bag for me because it is sad, but not a tearjerker like the movie wants it to be.The musical score by Dan Deacon makes no impression on me. It just sounds like generic music from any other movie. The needle drops are okay, but I wish they could find another song than Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. However, the credits song One Last Dance by Tom and Roman Morello and Grandson is really catchy and a great song to end the movie. Also, Maroon 5's Memories has a great needle drop here.Venom: The Last Dance is an entertaining movie. It is not well-made and not even as fun as the first film, but I overall had a pretty good time with the movie despite the many issues it has. I guess I cannot help but find Eddie and Venom a lot of fun to watch. Director Kelly Marcel did a great job with the scenes with those two and with the action scenes, but I think she bit off more than she could chew with the other subplots. If you like the Venom movies, you will probably enjoy this movie but if you never them then this movie will not change your mind.Stay through all of the credits.",Positive
551,"It is genuinely impressive that Sony managed to make the most mediocre trilogy ever with such an iconic character.In terms of enjoyment, Eddie and Venom continue to be a delightfully fun duo. In this 3rd movie, they are basically on a road trip and that was relatively entertaining for the most part. The final act of the movie was also a pretty enjoyable CGI action fest with some emotional scenes.However, the story and script are still as flat as ever. The narrative feels very half baked with it feeling like a chain of things just randomly happening. Pointless characters that don't add much. Jokes being thrown at you just to see which land. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor characters could have been played by anyone but feels purposely done because they knew fans recognised them from other Marvel projects. The villain Knull looks cool but is just there to be teased for future projects.Overall, it is better than the second film but just on par with the first. It is a mediocre final entry. Sony continues to disappoint with their universe and We all know Venom is coming back somehow. I do worry for Spiderman 4 and hope Sony don't mess that movie in anyway.",Neutral
552,"""Venom: The Last Dance' is a messy buddy road trip in which you must turn your brains off...again.Is it perfect? Nah, far from it. I think there are way too many storylines in here, and the main one got some potential, but it was wasted in typical Sony fashion. The ""Spider-Man 4"" rumors have been blown out of proportion in my opinion, so temper your expectations.The duo between Eddie and Venom is as fun as always. I mean Tom Hardy and the banter between them...I'm sorry, the banter between Hardy and himself is the best part of these movies (Hardy is doing the voice of Venom).The humor is there, but can't say I laughed all that much, beacause most of the jokes are base level childish again. It must be a bit more emotional as a whole, because supposedly is the last time we see Venom (hardly doubt), but it ends up kinda hollow.Knull is there...I guess, but will see how and when they'll use him again...it's Sony after all.It's a popcorn movie that reminds me of the early 2000's comic book movies. The action in the third act is good for the most parts and there are some funny moments here and there. Are there plot holes and some issues with the story? Yes. It's just another ""Turn your brains off"" Sony movie again.There are two credit scenes, first one is kinda important, the second one not so much.",Positive
553,"My relationship with the Venom franchise has been rocky. I have a soft spot for the first one, absolutely loathe the second, and now we come to the trilogy's closer, and thankfully, it's an improvement.Venom: The Last Dance works best when it focuses on Eddie and Venom's story instead of trying to set up the future of the Sonyverse. If you didn't like the previous Venom films, this won't change your mind. It's still messy, but it gets more right than its predecessors.This is easily the campiest and most mature of the bunch. It takes its time with the characters, letting us sit with them instead of rushing into the next action set piece. Still being PG-13 it manages to cram in a lot more gore than its predecessors. The action is inventive, and the humor hits its mark. It also doesn't shy away from getting personal and emotional. Eddie and Venom's relationship has never felt more genuine. I'll admit-I teared up a few times by the end.Some may be disappointed by the potrayal of Knull, but personally, I loved it. He feels like an overlooming threat rather than an one-off villain, and the ""God of Darkness"" gets a Thanos-esque treatment he deserves.Now, don't get me wrong-the movie is still bad, technically speaking-but it's self-aware about that. Instead of being ""bad bad,"" it chooses to be ""fun bad"" and entertain you, and I respect that. Not every movie needs to be great; sometimes being fun is enough.Even with the lows, I have always found a weird sense of comfort with this rendition of Venom. I have found myself caring more for these characters than maybe even the script intended. So I am happy to say that by the end, it does enough to justify this trilogy's existence - and to such an satisfying extent that I'd rather live in a world where the Venom movies exist than one where it doesn't.",Positive
554,"The third installment about the symbiotic anti-hero is a mix of bright moments and disappointments. Tom Hardy once again proves why he is the perfect choice for the role of Eddie Brock/Venom, but even his charismatic performance cannot save the unbalanced ensemble. The film starts off promisingly - with dynamic action and witty dialogue between Eddie and his symbiotic companion. Their relationship is still the best the series has to offer. Hardy brilliantly manages both comedic timing and dramatic moments. The visual effects are impressive in places, especially in the action sequences where Venom shows off his abilities. At other times, however, the CGI feels inadequate and more reminiscent of a video game from the last decade. Some fights are well choreographed, others are a chaotic mix of digital effects. The biggest problem is the script, which tries to be too ambitious. It mixes several storylines, introduces new characters and antagonists, but does not give them enough space to develop. The result is a rushed pace and superficial characters. The film's darker tone is a welcome change, but it often clashes with the comedic elements, creating an unbalanced whole. The film seems unsure whether it wants to be a serious drama or a lighthearted entertainment. Venom: The Last Dance is like a roller coaster - it's ups and downs. For fans of the series, it offers enough fun, but it's hard to call it a significant step forward. This film is like an average song on a great album, but as a whole it doesn't leave a strong impression. Fans will find their own, others may be disappointed.",Positive
555,"Maybe it's just because of my low expectations toward the series but it was just fun to watch. I've already lost hope for the trilogy to have a decent plot but I can say that this one has a better storyline than the second film.CGI was fine, I coudn't find any disturbing point. It was interesting to see the other symbiotes. I think those new symbiotes showed more symbiote-ish action scenes than venom when it comes to the fight ironically.There were a few funny jokes that made me laugh but I didn't really find Eddie's weird obsession for shoes funny, like was it supposed to be funny? Guess it was meant to be humor but well... it was almost tiring.",Neutral
556,"A solid enough send off for this 'Venom' trilogy.'Venom: The Last Dance' is decently amusing and produces enough entertainment with its plot. I didn't personally find it overly funny, though the person a few seats across from me had an absolute blast - never a bad thing seeing people enjoy themselves!Tom Hardy remains the key element of these films, they would be far less enjoyable without his presence. There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor stick out most from the other characters.",Negative

558,"Being Rated R probably would have saved this; I am just saying!This trilogy-capper almost makes me question if I have become more of a movie critic than a movie enjoyer. Then I remembered this is Sony's Spider-Man Universe we are talking about, which gave us films like ""Morbius"" and ""Madame Web."" I nonetheless went in here with an open mind, considering I do not mind the two previous ""Venom"" films that came out. After seeing ""The Last Dance,"" I question whether Sony was trying to set up their universe or give Eddie Brock and Venom the send-off they deserve. I am sadly leaning more toward the former.I should preface this review by telling you what I thought of the other two ""Venom"" films upon rewatch in preparation for this third installment. Those were entertaining yet disappointing superhero films saved by the performance of Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and Venom. The first was innocent enough, with a dull first and more engaging second half, a weak villain in Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake/Riot, exciting action, and Hardy performing nicely. Its sequel, ""Let There Be Carnage,"" surprisingly got better when revisiting it, easily surpassing its predecessor, with Hardy allowed to stretch his comedic abilities with Brock and Venom bickering hilariously. In addition, there is Woody Harrelson's enjoyable performance as Cletus Kasady/Carnage, who manages to rise above the flaws, including the disappointing inclusion of Naomie Harris' Frances Barrison/Shriek. Hardy was allowed to have fun with his characters, and the movies complimented him with a narrative that was not too complicated. The opposite is true for ""The Last Dance.""Let's get the positives out of the way first. It is a short list, which I am deeply saddened by, but I want to show you how it is not the worst superhero film out there or even the worst film of the year.Despite a woeful screenplay, Tom Hardy still does skillfully with Eddie Brock and Venom. He is not allowed to have as much fun as he did in the prior two films, but he is trying his best (right, the positives. Sorry).The rest of the cast delivered equally solid performances, with the other standout being Chiwetel Ejiofor as Orwell Taylor. Ejiofor always has a commanding presence whenever he is in a movie, with his characters of Baron Mordo in the two ""Doctor Strange"" films and Bathurst 2020 in the forgettable ""Infinite"" being the two I can think of at the top of my head. Even if the film is not the best, Ejiofor makes it work, and if it is fantastic, he always steals the show.The visual effects bring Venom and the other alien characters to gorgeous life. The other two ""Venom"" movies, granted, had remarkable CGI, but it is worth mentioning, specifically when discussing the positives.The action is somewhat fun. The ""Venom"" movies have always had enjoyable action. Unfortunately, ""The Last Dance"" was the least fun action-wise, but the first scene with action was sweet.The Venom symbiote is sometimes uniquely utilized. The trailers showcased Venom controlling a horse, and in the film, it is one of its best scenes. I am unsure if this is a spoiler, but he controls other animals, and they introduce other symbiotes, which is fun.I think that is it for the positives.I felt the portrayal of Eddie Brock and Venom this time was not good. Again, Hardy tried, but there were multiple times when it felt like he was bored. His character was, admittedly, bored at intervals, and Hardy is a screenwriter, but I am saying how it felt.The film tries to add new characters, but they are not compelling. The most obvious example is Dr. Payne, played by Juno Temple, who does nothing aside from believing that Brock is not a danger, while Ejiofor wants what is best for the world, considering the alien threat from Knull.Speaking of Knull, he was worse than Carlton Drake. He only sends alien minions to grab a MacGuffin that Venom has. I have not read the comics, but the impression I get from others and this movie is that Knull has a profound lore not represented here. Having Knull's alien pals and the Area 51 agents as the villains is too much, yet somehow too little.They also wasted Stephen Graham's Detective Mulligan. The trailers made it seem like Mulligan would be a principal and intriguing character. The only two interesting aspects about Mulligan are he has a symbiote and warns of Knull. That is it.Furthermore, it does not have that much comedy. ""Let There Be Carnage"" can easily be classified as a comedy, and I laughed more than I would like to admit. I think two laughs and three to five chuckles were all I had here. The film was not funny outside of the Venom horse and some banter between Brock and Venom.On top of that, there was not that much emotion. It is due to how much Brock and Venom were not well utilized and the clutter of characters. I did not care about the Area 51 personnel nor the unnamed family who brought Brock and Venom to Vegas. When the ending came along, which heightened the stakes to an unbelievable degree, I did not get emotional. It tried, but it failed to work.The other two ""Venom"" movies were entertaining, but this failed to come close. In an era where ""superhero fatigue"" is becoming more accepted, this trilogy-closer did not try anything new. Fascinating concepts here and there, and many standout scenes fail to save this disappointment in a franchise filled with them.Technically, a 6/10. Outside of the plot and the underwhelming screenplay, the visual effects remain exceptional, the actors did great, and the film functions.For the enjoyment score, I wanted to like this film. I had the sneaking suspicion that it might not work, but watching ""Let There Be Carnage"" increase in quality gave me hope. It was no ""Let There Be Carnage"" and is easily the weakest of the trilogy. It had the issues that plagued the likes of ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but does not come close to being as entertaining as them. I am so unhappy that the enjoyment score is a 4/10, but this trilogy deserved a better conclusion. Maybe it will get better when I watch it again, but as it stands, it is best for me to recommend you wait until Netflix or even Disney+.",Positive
559,"This movie was very middle of the road to me. Definitely better than the second one, but not as good as the original.I enjoyed the beginning very much. Nice pace, good story and funny at times. Also the last part was packed with action and it all looked amazing. Only thing I missed was some sort of a climax at the very end.The middle however, I did not care for too much. Some things felt forced, rushed and very unlikely. But as I often say in my reviews: 'It is a fictional, fantasy, action movie so who cares if some things do not add up.'As a whole I enjoyed it very much, Tom Hardy did not disappoint.",Positive
560,"I just don't get it, I thought the 1st Venom was good despite many fans may not have liked it. I'm not a comic fan, so for me it was good that they try to make it as relatable and realistic to just your average movie goer.The 2nd film was cringy and terrible in my opinion because the story didn't make much sense, too much drama, poetry, and bromance. I lost interest after watching that one but the trailer for this film looked good.Right from the beginning I realize this was going to be bad. I don't care about the multi-verse, I don't care about Knull, I don't care about all these comic lores. The story is completely unrelatable and the suspension of disbelief failed early on.And then to top it off, the ending was just awful.4/10 for the special effects. Everything else is a 0.",Negative
561,"If you've already come to terms with this version of Venom and Eddie Brock as more of a bromance than the savage, brutal duo from the comics, you're in for a fun ride, Venom: The Last Dance, the final chapter of the trilogy, delivers an entertaining ride with solid pacing, good performances, decent visual effects, and fun engaging enough story, added also with the joy of let all the madness fan service out makes Venom: The Last Dance an easy good time especially for me, even the serious part mostly with Chiwetel Ejiofor was executed pretty well, surprising wholesome moments with Rhys Ifans and his family characters, flawed? Sure, some of the editing cuts didn't quite work for me, there were a few cheesy, awkward moments that felt off, and nit picky here and there, overall, i have a good time with Venom: The Last Dance, and the most surprising thing also the least thing i could expect watching this supposed to be last time we'll see both Venom and Eddie was that i did get quite emotional at the end, it's clear they've evolved from mere host and symbiote to something much deeper, and their dynamic was surprisingly touching, my personal experience with these two also comes as long as these three movies together, and as the movie itself whether it's better than the first one which also a good movie in my opinion, The Last Dance succeeded my expectation from being far from bad, i want this goodbye to be at least watchable enough, and the result is more than that, Venom: The Last Dance is actually a good film, just like Venom would say, We are Venom, and this film makes sure we feel it.",Negative
562,"Fun, wild, and hot mess. There's too much plot that's never explained. Events just happen randomly with no payoff, with a big action scene towards the end. Eddie & Venom Bromance is the savior of this trilogy. If you enjoy the others you will enjoy this.Synopsis:
In Venom: The Last Dance, Tom Hardy returns as Venom, one of Marvel's greatest and most complex characters, for the final film in the trilogy. Eddie and Venom are on the run. Hunted by both of their worlds and with the net closing in, the duo are forced into a devastating decision that will bring the curtains down on Venom and Eddie's last dance.",Positive
563,"If you were hoping for a grand finale to the Venom franchise that would surpass the comedic heights of its predecessors, you're in for a letdown. While Venom: The Last Dance does deliver on the comedic front, it falls short in nearly every other aspect.The film picks up right where we left off, with Eddie Brock and Venom still on the run. The plot takes a convoluted turn as they become embroiled in a government conspiracy involving symbiotes and a dangerous threat to the universe. While the premise is intriguing, the execution feels rushed and often confusing.The real draw of this film, as with its predecessors, is the chemistry between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom. Their banter and witty exchanges provide much-needed humor and keep the film entertaining. However, the comedic elements can feel forced at times, and the overall tone can be uneven.The film's biggest flaw is its reliance on poor CGI and even worse dialogue. The visual effects, particularly those involving the titular symbiote, often feel like a step back from previous entries. Venom's appearances are fleeting, and when he does appear in full form, he's often overshadowed by lackluster animation.The script is equally disappointing. The story lacks depth and originality, and the characters feel one-dimensional. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the pacing feels uneven. While there are a few moments of humor that might elicit a chuckle, they're not enough to salvage the film.Ultimately, Venom: The Last Dance is a missed opportunity. It's a shame that such a potentially fun franchise has ended on such a sour note.",Negative
564,"If cinematic catastrophes could have a mascot, this would be standing at the front of the line, waving its tattered flag of mediocrity. Tom Hardy's final outing as Eddie Brock/Venom is not just a disappointment-it's an insult to audiences everywhere. To call this movie bad would be a kindness. This is an incoherent, muddled, and utterly joyless mess that somehow manages to fall short of even the lowest expectations.The premise of Eddie and Venom being ""on the run"" from both worlds promised at least some thrilling action. Instead, what we get is a chaotic, poorly-scripted nightmare of disjointed scenes and absurd plot holes big enough to swallow the entire Marvel universe. The narrative, if you can call it that, lurches forward with all the grace of a drunken man stumbling in the dark. There is no rhyme or reason to the events that unfold. It's like the writers cobbled together every half-baked idea they could think of and hoped nobody would notice how little sense any of it makes.The so-called ""devastating decision"" that Eddie and Venom face feels less like a culmination of their journey and more like a cheap, hollow ploy to yank on the audience's emotions. But even that attempt falls flat because, by the time it arrives, the viewer is too exhausted from enduring 90 minutes of mindless drivel to care.Eddie Brock, once a complex and conflicted anti-hero from the source comics, is reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self, mumbling and stumbling through the film like he just wants to get it over with.The supporting characters are even worse-if that's possible. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use cardboard cutouts of side characters nobody cares about and clearly has no understanding of what made the earlier films (barely) work.They serve no purpose other than to waste screen time and remind us that, yes, someone actually wrote this drivel down on paper.It wouldn't be a Venom movie without over-the-top CGI battles, right? Well, unfortunately, the action scenes here are so poorly executed and short to save cost that even those who came purely for mindless entertainment will leave disappointed. The special effects are a headache-inducing blur of dark, indistinguishable shapes smashing into each other, with zero sense of tension or creativity.The final fight scene feels like -an unintelligible swirl of chaos that is supposed to distract us from the fact that nothing of consequence is happening. It's not exciting, it's not entertaining, it's just ugly.At its core it tries to sell itself as a dramatic, emotional farewell to Eddie and Venom's bond, but it doesn't even come close to achieving that. Any attempt at emotional weight is drowned by the film's clumsy pacing and complete lack of character development. The so-called ""devastating"" decision feels unearned, forced, and utterly unconvincing. There is no sense of closure, no satisfying payoff-just a hollow, empty finale that leaves you wondering why you wasted your time in the first place.Avoid this movie like the symbiote plague it is. Eddie and Venom deserved better. We all deserved better.Tom's ego and nepotism to promote his FWB director both of whom had sole credit of writing the script should tell you that how much he actually despises the franchise.Tom was the ultimate culprit is giving the first movie it's comic tone and had heated arguments with Ruben Flesicher on set to such an extent that filming halted for a few days. There were 3 script writers on the first movie can you guess who was one of them?It's the director of this movie who with her relationship strong armed and hijacked the plot elements and forced to introduce the comic tone into the first movie by reshooting the movie which had resulted in a disjointed mess.Even the Ruben had expressed his deep regrets about that but I guess if you can control the leading star you can have your way.If you closely look at the tone of the first movie first trailer you will notice the horror and science fiction elements present which had been stripped down to barebones and gag and quips reigned supreme.",Negative
565,"My wife and I watched Venom: The Last Dance (2024) last night in theaters. The storyline follows Eddie Brock, who is on the run from the law and hiding in Mexico. When an invasion from Venom's home world begins, Eddie must make his way to Area 51 to find reinforcements and fight off the invaders.Directed by Kelly Marcel in her directorial debut, the film stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Rhys Ifans (The Amazing Spider-Man), Stephen Graham (Snatch), and Juno Temple (Killer Joe).I absolutely loved the first two-thirds of this film. Tom Hardy nailed his role, bringing a perfect blend of humor, action, and Venom's signature appetite for chaos. The various forms Venom takes are visually entertaining, and the self-deprecating humor is spot-on. We especially enjoyed the introduction of a quirky ""hippie family,"" who added a fun twist. However, once the story shifts to Area 51, things feel rushed and forced. The other symbiotes look incredible, but they come and go so quickly that you're left wanting more. The villain's defeat also felt underwhelming, and I wanted a bit more depth in their storyline. The homage at the end felt somewhat awkward as well.In conclusion, Venom: The Last Dance is a fun watch and definitely worth seeing for fans of the character, though it doesn't quite reach its full potential. I'd rate it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Positive

567,"Venom 3 is fun movie. It will never be critically rated, but it doesn't need or try to be. It is fun, it is weird, it looks good and the interactions between Eddie and Venom are great as always and are funny unlike the forced jokes that don't always land. We get to see a bit more of the rest of the symbiotes, but it is not a major focus of the movie to introduce or highlight them, which was a bit disappointing personally. The storyline is a bit messy, and there are a few plotholes and illogical, unexplainable events, but the movie does a good job of actually taking the viewers through it. We get and ending to the trilogy that is pretty much what you expect, but the emotional charge of it feels a bit forced and doesn't let the viewer appreciate it for themselves. We also get a glimpse of what may come in the future, including a namedrop that comic fans will get, so we may see more of our goofy antihero in the future.",Positive
568,"Venom The Last Dance was hilarious, emotional and entertaining. Went in with the same expectations as before very low. I'm shocked about the critics, cause they expected much more unreal scenarios. Here again Sony is not stupid of course they'd have added a specific character in their world, but they probably can't because of a certain contract clause. The third movie is much better than the second cause the second movie suffered from extreme cuts which took out all its potential. Despite the fact that Venom was rumored and in productions ever since early 00s it's no wonder they made a trilogy and had box office success, cause Tom Hardy carried those movies on his own. Every other actor wouldn't be able to pull out this great chemistry between him and Venom. I'm not biased I see its flaws and weaknesses, but my God some critics thrashed this movie as if it's another Morbius or Madame Web. It's by far a better movie.The road trip family was adorable not necessary but there to add a more family atmosphere and emotional touch to this film. Juno Temple was good but underperformed and here background story was dragged into this movie.Ms Cheng was probably the best positive highlight of the movie besides the love for dogs and animals in general.A lot of great symbionts and designs were actually great to watch. I can't say much more to that point cause I want to avoid spoilers.The issuesThe plot and goal of the movie is clear but gets lost through the movie. The action sequences and CGI were average at best. I know that sounds awful for a higher rating, but hear me out. The cast was decent and some actors really shined here.Another problem is the camera work here too many fast cuts hardly to see specially when I think I was obligated to watch it in 3D. I prefer 2D.The biggest problem was there is no clear 1 v 1 villain here with heart and intentions. We have Knull as the big bad in the background but barely seen but only to bait us fans to watch it and another mystery character from the army or swat like crew not shown at all. Where as the first two movies had clear antagonists shown.Issue / or averageThe Ending was emotional and impactful with rushed bangs, but man there were some scenes I really felt touched by it. I still think they could've done more and Tom deserved more !I give it 6 but as a trilogy part and the Tom Hardy factor a light 7, cause reviews between 1-4 stars are harsh. And yeah don't leave there are two important post credit scenes. I'm really looking forward !",Positive

570,"Barely emotional. Barely funny. Barely mediocre. From this pattern, it can be deducted that Venom: The Last Dance is a passable movie that doesn't do enough right to feel like an epic send off, or do anything inherently wrong to be worth complaining about. It's just fine.Tom Hardy is once again the easy stand-out as Eddie Brock, using the same janky physical actions as Venom manipulates his movements to an entertaining degree. The humour is the same safe but fine lines of dialogue that either evoke a chuckle or short exhale of breath. The action scenes escalate in levels of excitement throughout the film, with the final act especially delivering some really fun mayhem. And being the supposed final film of the trilogy, there are some surprisingly tender moments sprinkled in, but aren't frequent enough to draw any real emotion.As aforementioned, the humour is fine but there's one particular segment of the film in Las Vegas that feels too ridiculous and reckless in the context of the movie. Moreover, the story sets up rules that either get contradicted, forgotten, or straight up ignored for the sake of 'cool' scenes. Aside from Eddie and Venom, the rest of the cast of characters come off as either underutilised, underdeveloped, or unnecessary. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rhys Ifans feel criminally wasted, Juno Temple and Clark Backo undermine each other as their characters could've been just compiled into one due to their similar traits, and Stephen Graham and Peggy Lu don't do much to feel properly utilised, especially Graham, who's character felt like was building up to a bigger pay-off than what we got. And the antagonist Knull was so sidelined that there's not much more to say about him other than 'he was in the movie'.In conclusion, for what Venom: The Last Dance can't deliver in a concise plot or compelling side characters, it manages to make up for it with fun symbiote action and mostly entertaining and semi-heartfelt sequences.",Negative
571,"Sony should publicly apologise to the audience for making this worst movie and make the audience suffer and wasted their time. So boring story, nothing to appreciate only actor (Tom Hardy) has done, good acting Else, everyone, not done anything to discuss, that's why am giving one star.Don't waste your money by going into the theatres. CGI was good, but story was so pathetic. You can just guess the whole picture by trailer waste of money. Tom Hardy should try superhero movies with other Studios sony is not good with superheroes. We have already seen this with Superman. Middle part was so boring and ending was too predictable.",Negative
572,"Venom: The Last Dance delivers exactly what it promises-an absurdly fun, high-octane ride with a surprising amount of heart. If you expected Avengers: Endgame level of finality, you walked into the wrong theater, but for those who wanted a dumb but entertaining alien-human bromance, this one's for you.This film is easily the best in the trilogy, blending sharp pacing, humor that actually lands, and action sequences that never feel forced. The weird yet charming dynamic between Eddie and Venom is in full swing, and the filmmakers know exactly how to tap into the ridiculous yet endearing relationship that has become the backbone of this series. It's self-aware without feeling desperate for laughs, striking a balance that's tough to nail in superhero movies these days.While some of the gore pushes the limits of PG-13, it's never gratuitous. There's enough bite to the violence to keep you hooked, but it stops short of being overwhelming. If anything, it adds a little edge to an otherwise slick, polished blockbuster.But the real kicker here is that, amidst all the chaos, Venom: The Last Dance sneaks in some genuine emotion. It's a film about keeping your best bro close, and somehow that works. So why all the hate? It's a popcorn flick that knows exactly what it is, and honestly, that's rare these days.",Positive
573,Almost the whole cast was full. The only cast members that helped was the family and of course the store lady. Mulligan was boring . I felt there was a power struggle when writing this. One wanted to show ase strong women yet made them look stupied and to emotional; while the other smart men but utterly useless in the long run causing more havoc and not thinking before moving.The CGI are as ok. The one creatures could have been way way more creative for sure.Over all it's a lack luster film unfortunately 😕..there's so much they could have done with Tom and this story line. We needed a version of him and Spider man yet have been robbed of that.,Negative
574,"First and foremost, it felt like the makers made every poor decision possible when it came to the sound tracks and music. That which is supposed to amplify the intensity of ride simply let it remain bland throughout, even the climax, even the falling action.With Venom and Eddie having largely ceased their bickering, their bromance has dwindled significantly in this movie. Being the conclusional piece of this hilarious trilogy, it has fallen short of many expectations.Of course there was some of those promised action as witnessed in the trailers. But was there something which swept me off my feet which was absent from the trailers? Not really.While the villain's back-story is rather solid, it could have been more centre-stage. Most of the characters that have made appearance in this movie felt weakly woven together; though the plot could not have moved forward without their roles, they barely left any impact. Speaking of the plot, it largely remains uneventful, with the makers just throwing a few name-sake 3D effect villainous creatures at our faces. There is only one major action sequence throughout the film, that it low-key has bottled down to something I would either skim through, or watch at a slightly increased playback speed.If the unnecessary scenes, and by that I mean, 'adding no humor or value to the plot' scenes were deleted, it could easily boil down to half its current run-time. That being said, there could definitely be leads from where this movie has left loose ends at, but presently, it stays far aloof from being involved in such a gifting.I feel like the last of the trilogy has not done justice to the previous two movies, it almost feels like watching a different character. The ending in particular came off to me as a tryhard terrific ending, and even if the clips were good, the track choices really did not work out for me.",Negative
575,"Eddie and Venom are on the run as fugitives after their battle with Carnage. They are chased by military force and aliens that want to capture them for their codex to unleash a greater evil in their world. Eddie and Venom venture out for a while avoiding authorities and the alien species.I am a fan of the first Venom movie. It is not a well-made movie, but it is so entertaining because of Tom Hardy's crazy performance in both roles and the wacky humor throughout the film. The second movie is much better made mainly because of Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris, but I actually enjoyed the first one more on a fun level. I was pretty excited for the third film and the trailers had me hooked. Does this trilogy end on a memorable last dance?I have mixed thoughts on Venom: The Last Dance. Let's start with the good. I love Eddie and Venom's dynamic and they are at their best in this movie. They have fun chemistry and banter and it feels like they are finally starting to get along with each other a bit better. They also have a few emotional moments that can come off as cheesy, but they have charm especially one scene where Eddie reassures Martin's son that his alien friend is there to help and Venom thanks the kid for a piece of chocolate. In a movie filled with silly moments and action-packed battles, it is a really sweet moment that shows how heroic Eddie and Venom have become.It helps that Tom Hardy is an absolute joy to watch. Hardy relishes in both of his roles and he never lets up. There are several moments of him doing stuff like going crazy at the slot machine and creating a drink at the bar by himself in a quick way. He also handles the more dramatic scenes very well making the more emotional moments work better than they should have.Also, Venom is a very cool character here. He is funny, his powers are awesome and he does anything to protect Eddie even knowing that if they are both alive the aliens will track them down because they have a codex. Venom's antics are very endearing and it seems like he just wants to join the fun and even tries to get Eddie to join in. I love watching him take control of other animals such as a horse, a fish and a frog. Venom is so much fun to watch and he is a good reason why I enjoy these movies despite their faults.The humor is for the most part pretty good. There is one gag that I cringed at but other than that, I got several laughs out of this movie. The banter between Eddie and Venom never gets old for me.The action scenes are pretty entertaining. The chase scene in the river is a standout because it looks cool, it has Eddie Brock defend himself without Venom and Venom turning into other creatures. It is also frenetic and fun to see play out. The climax is also big full of cool moments, but it is a little CGI heavy. However, it features Venom on a motorcycle again and it looks great. Overall, I enjoyed the action.The cinematography by Fabian Wagner is solid and colorful. The lighting is also on point with all of the scenes being lit well enough to see while having some flare in the shots. This is by far the best looking Venom movie filmmaking wise. The special effects are more polished and the alien creatures chasing Venom and Eddie look very menacing. Honestly, they kind of remind me of the Kaijus from Pacific Rim and I like that. There also other symbiotes in the film and they look very cool with their designs, but some of their colors blend in. The visuals are not perfect, but they are an upgrade from the last two movies.All that said, there are a few problems I have with this movie. The biggest problem is that the script is overstuffed. I know that there needs to other plot lines to have the story come together, but some of them do not work at all. The scientists subplot is one of the most boring parts of the movie with how slowly paced it is and how the tone shifts from fun to dreary and not the good kind of dreary. The subplot with Martin and his family is okay and has some great moments, but it can drag a little too long.The supporting cast does not hold a candle to Tom Hardy. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Rex Strickland is the best supporting performance, but his character is too unlikable to root for. Dr. Payne is kind of there until the climax. Clark Backo as Sadie Christmas is alright and she does a lot in the climax, but her character does not stand out until then. Rhys Ifans is having a lot of fun in his role as a family man who believes in aliens. While his family may have gotten a little more focus than they should have, Ifans is pretty fun to watch at times. Andy Serkis as Knull is absolutely wasted. He seems like a menacing villain, but he gets little to do aside from getting expository dialogue. By far, the weakest link in the film and wastes Andy Serkis on a limited role.The tone is all over the place. There are moments where this movie acts like a cheesy road trip comedy with Eddie and Venom and then the next scene could be overly serious research about the symbiotes. The movie progressively darker as it goes along and it has some moments that should come off as emotional and while they kind of work because of Tom Hardy's performance and the duo's likability, they feel a bit unearned because of how comedic this series is by now. When Eddie and Venom ponder the life they could have had when in the car with Martin's family, it is hard to feel anything because they have been two goofballs most of the time. Without spoiling anything, ending is a mixed bag for me because it is sad, but not a tearjerker like the movie wants it to be.The musical score by Dan Deacon makes no impression on me. It just sounds like generic music from any other movie. The needle drops are okay, but I wish they could find another song than Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. However, the credits song One Last Dance by Tom and Roman Morello and Grandson is really catchy and a great song to end the movie. Also, Maroon 5's Memories has a great needle drop here.Venom: The Last Dance is an entertaining movie. It is not well-made and not even as fun as the first film, but I overall had a pretty good time with the movie despite the many issues it has. I guess I cannot help but find Eddie and Venom a lot of fun to watch. Director Kelly Marcel did a great job with the scenes with those two and with the action scenes, but I think she bit off more than she could chew with the other subplots. If you like the Venom movies, you will probably enjoy this movie but if you never them then this movie will not change your mind.Stay through all of the credits.",Positive
576,"It is genuinely impressive that Sony managed to make the most mediocre trilogy ever with such an iconic character.In terms of enjoyment, Eddie and Venom continue to be a delightfully fun duo. In this 3rd movie, they are basically on a road trip and that was relatively entertaining for the most part. The final act of the movie was also a pretty enjoyable CGI action fest with some emotional scenes.However, the story and script are still as flat as ever. The narrative feels very half baked with it feeling like a chain of things just randomly happening. Pointless characters that don't add much. Jokes being thrown at you just to see which land. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor characters could have been played by anyone but feels purposely done because they knew fans recognised them from other Marvel projects. The villain Knull looks cool but is just there to be teased for future projects.Overall, it is better than the second film but just on par with the first. It is a mediocre final entry. Sony continues to disappoint with their universe and We all know Venom is coming back somehow. I do worry for Spiderman 4 and hope Sony don't mess that movie in anyway.",Neutral
577,"""Venom: The Last Dance' is a messy buddy road trip in which you must turn your brains off...again.Is it perfect? Nah, far from it. I think there are way too many storylines in here, and the main one got some potential, but it was wasted in typical Sony fashion. The ""Spider-Man 4"" rumors have been blown out of proportion in my opinion, so temper your expectations.The duo between Eddie and Venom is as fun as always. I mean Tom Hardy and the banter between them...I'm sorry, the banter between Hardy and himself is the best part of these movies (Hardy is doing the voice of Venom).The humor is there, but can't say I laughed all that much, beacause most of the jokes are base level childish again. It must be a bit more emotional as a whole, because supposedly is the last time we see Venom (hardly doubt), but it ends up kinda hollow.Knull is there...I guess, but will see how and when they'll use him again...it's Sony after all.It's a popcorn movie that reminds me of the early 2000's comic book movies. The action in the third act is good for the most parts and there are some funny moments here and there. Are there plot holes and some issues with the story? Yes. It's just another ""Turn your brains off"" Sony movie again.There are two credit scenes, first one is kinda important, the second one not so much.",Positive
578,"My relationship with the Venom franchise has been rocky. I have a soft spot for the first one, absolutely loathe the second, and now we come to the trilogy's closer, and thankfully, it's an improvement.Venom: The Last Dance works best when it focuses on Eddie and Venom's story instead of trying to set up the future of the Sonyverse. If you didn't like the previous Venom films, this won't change your mind. It's still messy, but it gets more right than its predecessors.This is easily the campiest and most mature of the bunch. It takes its time with the characters, letting us sit with them instead of rushing into the next action set piece. Still being PG-13 it manages to cram in a lot more gore than its predecessors. The action is inventive, and the humor hits its mark. It also doesn't shy away from getting personal and emotional. Eddie and Venom's relationship has never felt more genuine. I'll admit-I teared up a few times by the end.Some may be disappointed by the potrayal of Knull, but personally, I loved it. He feels like an overlooming threat rather than an one-off villain, and the ""God of Darkness"" gets a Thanos-esque treatment he deserves.Now, don't get me wrong-the movie is still bad, technically speaking-but it's self-aware about that. Instead of being ""bad bad,"" it chooses to be ""fun bad"" and entertain you, and I respect that. Not every movie needs to be great; sometimes being fun is enough.Even with the lows, I have always found a weird sense of comfort with this rendition of Venom. I have found myself caring more for these characters than maybe even the script intended. So I am happy to say that by the end, it does enough to justify this trilogy's existence - and to such an satisfying extent that I'd rather live in a world where the Venom movies exist than one where it doesn't.",Positive
579,"The third installment about the symbiotic anti-hero is a mix of bright moments and disappointments. Tom Hardy once again proves why he is the perfect choice for the role of Eddie Brock/Venom, but even his charismatic performance cannot save the unbalanced ensemble. The film starts off promisingly - with dynamic action and witty dialogue between Eddie and his symbiotic companion. Their relationship is still the best the series has to offer. Hardy brilliantly manages both comedic timing and dramatic moments. The visual effects are impressive in places, especially in the action sequences where Venom shows off his abilities. At other times, however, the CGI feels inadequate and more reminiscent of a video game from the last decade. Some fights are well choreographed, others are a chaotic mix of digital effects. The biggest problem is the script, which tries to be too ambitious. It mixes several storylines, introduces new characters and antagonists, but does not give them enough space to develop. The result is a rushed pace and superficial characters. The film's darker tone is a welcome change, but it often clashes with the comedic elements, creating an unbalanced whole. The film seems unsure whether it wants to be a serious drama or a lighthearted entertainment. Venom: The Last Dance is like a roller coaster - it's ups and downs. For fans of the series, it offers enough fun, but it's hard to call it a significant step forward. This film is like an average song on a great album, but as a whole it doesn't leave a strong impression. Fans will find their own, others may be disappointed.",Positive
580,"Maybe it's just because of my low expectations toward the series but it was just fun to watch. I've already lost hope for the trilogy to have a decent plot but I can say that this one has a better storyline than the second film.CGI was fine, I coudn't find any disturbing point. It was interesting to see the other symbiotes. I think those new symbiotes showed more symbiote-ish action scenes than venom when it comes to the fight ironically.There were a few funny jokes that made me laugh but I didn't really find Eddie's weird obsession for shoes funny, like was it supposed to be funny? Guess it was meant to be humor but well... it was almost tiring.",Neutral
581,"A solid enough send off for this 'Venom' trilogy.'Venom: The Last Dance' is decently amusing and produces enough entertainment with its plot. I didn't personally find it overly funny, though the person a few seats across from me had an absolute blast - never a bad thing seeing people enjoy themselves!Tom Hardy remains the key element of these films, they would be far less enjoyable without his presence. There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor stick out most from the other characters.",Negative

583,"Being Rated R probably would have saved this; I am just saying!This trilogy-capper almost makes me question if I have become more of a movie critic than a movie enjoyer. Then I remembered this is Sony's Spider-Man Universe we are talking about, which gave us films like ""Morbius"" and ""Madame Web."" I nonetheless went in here with an open mind, considering I do not mind the two previous ""Venom"" films that came out. After seeing ""The Last Dance,"" I question whether Sony was trying to set up their universe or give Eddie Brock and Venom the send-off they deserve. I am sadly leaning more toward the former.I should preface this review by telling you what I thought of the other two ""Venom"" films upon rewatch in preparation for this third installment. Those were entertaining yet disappointing superhero films saved by the performance of Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and Venom. The first was innocent enough, with a dull first and more engaging second half, a weak villain in Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake/Riot, exciting action, and Hardy performing nicely. Its sequel, ""Let There Be Carnage,"" surprisingly got better when revisiting it, easily surpassing its predecessor, with Hardy allowed to stretch his comedic abilities with Brock and Venom bickering hilariously. In addition, there is Woody Harrelson's enjoyable performance as Cletus Kasady/Carnage, who manages to rise above the flaws, including the disappointing inclusion of Naomie Harris' Frances Barrison/Shriek. Hardy was allowed to have fun with his characters, and the movies complimented him with a narrative that was not too complicated. The opposite is true for ""The Last Dance.""Let's get the positives out of the way first. It is a short list, which I am deeply saddened by, but I want to show you how it is not the worst superhero film out there or even the worst film of the year.Despite a woeful screenplay, Tom Hardy still does skillfully with Eddie Brock and Venom. He is not allowed to have as much fun as he did in the prior two films, but he is trying his best (right, the positives. Sorry).The rest of the cast delivered equally solid performances, with the other standout being Chiwetel Ejiofor as Orwell Taylor. Ejiofor always has a commanding presence whenever he is in a movie, with his characters of Baron Mordo in the two ""Doctor Strange"" films and Bathurst 2020 in the forgettable ""Infinite"" being the two I can think of at the top of my head. Even if the film is not the best, Ejiofor makes it work, and if it is fantastic, he always steals the show.The visual effects bring Venom and the other alien characters to gorgeous life. The other two ""Venom"" movies, granted, had remarkable CGI, but it is worth mentioning, specifically when discussing the positives.The action is somewhat fun. The ""Venom"" movies have always had enjoyable action. Unfortunately, ""The Last Dance"" was the least fun action-wise, but the first scene with action was sweet.The Venom symbiote is sometimes uniquely utilized. The trailers showcased Venom controlling a horse, and in the film, it is one of its best scenes. I am unsure if this is a spoiler, but he controls other animals, and they introduce other symbiotes, which is fun.I think that is it for the positives.I felt the portrayal of Eddie Brock and Venom this time was not good. Again, Hardy tried, but there were multiple times when it felt like he was bored. His character was, admittedly, bored at intervals, and Hardy is a screenwriter, but I am saying how it felt.The film tries to add new characters, but they are not compelling. The most obvious example is Dr. Payne, played by Juno Temple, who does nothing aside from believing that Brock is not a danger, while Ejiofor wants what is best for the world, considering the alien threat from Knull.Speaking of Knull, he was worse than Carlton Drake. He only sends alien minions to grab a MacGuffin that Venom has. I have not read the comics, but the impression I get from others and this movie is that Knull has a profound lore not represented here. Having Knull's alien pals and the Area 51 agents as the villains is too much, yet somehow too little.They also wasted Stephen Graham's Detective Mulligan. The trailers made it seem like Mulligan would be a principal and intriguing character. The only two interesting aspects about Mulligan are he has a symbiote and warns of Knull. That is it.Furthermore, it does not have that much comedy. ""Let There Be Carnage"" can easily be classified as a comedy, and I laughed more than I would like to admit. I think two laughs and three to five chuckles were all I had here. The film was not funny outside of the Venom horse and some banter between Brock and Venom.On top of that, there was not that much emotion. It is due to how much Brock and Venom were not well utilized and the clutter of characters. I did not care about the Area 51 personnel nor the unnamed family who brought Brock and Venom to Vegas. When the ending came along, which heightened the stakes to an unbelievable degree, I did not get emotional. It tried, but it failed to work.The other two ""Venom"" movies were entertaining, but this failed to come close. In an era where ""superhero fatigue"" is becoming more accepted, this trilogy-closer did not try anything new. Fascinating concepts here and there, and many standout scenes fail to save this disappointment in a franchise filled with them.Technically, a 6/10. Outside of the plot and the underwhelming screenplay, the visual effects remain exceptional, the actors did great, and the film functions.For the enjoyment score, I wanted to like this film. I had the sneaking suspicion that it might not work, but watching ""Let There Be Carnage"" increase in quality gave me hope. It was no ""Let There Be Carnage"" and is easily the weakest of the trilogy. It had the issues that plagued the likes of ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but does not come close to being as entertaining as them. I am so unhappy that the enjoyment score is a 4/10, but this trilogy deserved a better conclusion. Maybe it will get better when I watch it again, but as it stands, it is best for me to recommend you wait until Netflix or even Disney+.",Positive
584,"This movie was very middle of the road to me. Definitely better than the second one, but not as good as the original.I enjoyed the beginning very much. Nice pace, good story and funny at times. Also the last part was packed with action and it all looked amazing. Only thing I missed was some sort of a climax at the very end.The middle however, I did not care for too much. Some things felt forced, rushed and very unlikely. But as I often say in my reviews: 'It is a fictional, fantasy, action movie so who cares if some things do not add up.'As a whole I enjoyed it very much, Tom Hardy did not disappoint.",Positive
585,"I just don't get it, I thought the 1st Venom was good despite many fans may not have liked it. I'm not a comic fan, so for me it was good that they try to make it as relatable and realistic to just your average movie goer.The 2nd film was cringy and terrible in my opinion because the story didn't make much sense, too much drama, poetry, and bromance. I lost interest after watching that one but the trailer for this film looked good.Right from the beginning I realize this was going to be bad. I don't care about the multi-verse, I don't care about Knull, I don't care about all these comic lores. The story is completely unrelatable and the suspension of disbelief failed early on.And then to top it off, the ending was just awful.4/10 for the special effects. Everything else is a 0.",Negative
586,"If you've already come to terms with this version of Venom and Eddie Brock as more of a bromance than the savage, brutal duo from the comics, you're in for a fun ride, Venom: The Last Dance, the final chapter of the trilogy, delivers an entertaining ride with solid pacing, good performances, decent visual effects, and fun engaging enough story, added also with the joy of let all the madness fan service out makes Venom: The Last Dance an easy good time especially for me, even the serious part mostly with Chiwetel Ejiofor was executed pretty well, surprising wholesome moments with Rhys Ifans and his family characters, flawed? Sure, some of the editing cuts didn't quite work for me, there were a few cheesy, awkward moments that felt off, and nit picky here and there, overall, i have a good time with Venom: The Last Dance, and the most surprising thing also the least thing i could expect watching this supposed to be last time we'll see both Venom and Eddie was that i did get quite emotional at the end, it's clear they've evolved from mere host and symbiote to something much deeper, and their dynamic was surprisingly touching, my personal experience with these two also comes as long as these three movies together, and as the movie itself whether it's better than the first one which also a good movie in my opinion, The Last Dance succeeded my expectation from being far from bad, i want this goodbye to be at least watchable enough, and the result is more than that, Venom: The Last Dance is actually a good film, just like Venom would say, We are Venom, and this film makes sure we feel it.",Negative
587,"Fun, wild, and hot mess. There's too much plot that's never explained. Events just happen randomly with no payoff, with a big action scene towards the end. Eddie & Venom Bromance is the savior of this trilogy. If you enjoy the others you will enjoy this.Synopsis:
In Venom: The Last Dance, Tom Hardy returns as Venom, one of Marvel's greatest and most complex characters, for the final film in the trilogy. Eddie and Venom are on the run. Hunted by both of their worlds and with the net closing in, the duo are forced into a devastating decision that will bring the curtains down on Venom and Eddie's last dance.",Positive
588,"If you were hoping for a grand finale to the Venom franchise that would surpass the comedic heights of its predecessors, you're in for a letdown. While Venom: The Last Dance does deliver on the comedic front, it falls short in nearly every other aspect.The film picks up right where we left off, with Eddie Brock and Venom still on the run. The plot takes a convoluted turn as they become embroiled in a government conspiracy involving symbiotes and a dangerous threat to the universe. While the premise is intriguing, the execution feels rushed and often confusing.The real draw of this film, as with its predecessors, is the chemistry between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom. Their banter and witty exchanges provide much-needed humor and keep the film entertaining. However, the comedic elements can feel forced at times, and the overall tone can be uneven.The film's biggest flaw is its reliance on poor CGI and even worse dialogue. The visual effects, particularly those involving the titular symbiote, often feel like a step back from previous entries. Venom's appearances are fleeting, and when he does appear in full form, he's often overshadowed by lackluster animation.The script is equally disappointing. The story lacks depth and originality, and the characters feel one-dimensional. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the pacing feels uneven. While there are a few moments of humor that might elicit a chuckle, they're not enough to salvage the film.Ultimately, Venom: The Last Dance is a missed opportunity. It's a shame that such a potentially fun franchise has ended on such a sour note.",Negative
589,"If cinematic catastrophes could have a mascot, this would be standing at the front of the line, waving its tattered flag of mediocrity. Tom Hardy's final outing as Eddie Brock/Venom is not just a disappointment-it's an insult to audiences everywhere. To call this movie bad would be a kindness. This is an incoherent, muddled, and utterly joyless mess that somehow manages to fall short of even the lowest expectations.The premise of Eddie and Venom being ""on the run"" from both worlds promised at least some thrilling action. Instead, what we get is a chaotic, poorly-scripted nightmare of disjointed scenes and absurd plot holes big enough to swallow the entire Marvel universe. The narrative, if you can call it that, lurches forward with all the grace of a drunken man stumbling in the dark. There is no rhyme or reason to the events that unfold. It's like the writers cobbled together every half-baked idea they could think of and hoped nobody would notice how little sense any of it makes.The so-called ""devastating decision"" that Eddie and Venom face feels less like a culmination of their journey and more like a cheap, hollow ploy to yank on the audience's emotions. But even that attempt falls flat because, by the time it arrives, the viewer is too exhausted from enduring 90 minutes of mindless drivel to care.Eddie Brock, once a complex and conflicted anti-hero from the source comics, is reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self, mumbling and stumbling through the film like he just wants to get it over with.The supporting characters are even worse-if that's possible. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use cardboard cutouts of side characters nobody cares about and clearly has no understanding of what made the earlier films (barely) work.They serve no purpose other than to waste screen time and remind us that, yes, someone actually wrote this drivel down on paper.It wouldn't be a Venom movie without over-the-top CGI battles, right? Well, unfortunately, the action scenes here are so poorly executed and short to save cost that even those who came purely for mindless entertainment will leave disappointed. The special effects are a headache-inducing blur of dark, indistinguishable shapes smashing into each other, with zero sense of tension or creativity.The final fight scene feels like -an unintelligible swirl of chaos that is supposed to distract us from the fact that nothing of consequence is happening. It's not exciting, it's not entertaining, it's just ugly.At its core it tries to sell itself as a dramatic, emotional farewell to Eddie and Venom's bond, but it doesn't even come close to achieving that. Any attempt at emotional weight is drowned by the film's clumsy pacing and complete lack of character development. The so-called ""devastating"" decision feels unearned, forced, and utterly unconvincing. There is no sense of closure, no satisfying payoff-just a hollow, empty finale that leaves you wondering why you wasted your time in the first place.Avoid this movie like the symbiote plague it is. Eddie and Venom deserved better. We all deserved better.Tom's ego and nepotism to promote his FWB director both of whom had sole credit of writing the script should tell you that how much he actually despises the franchise.Tom was the ultimate culprit is giving the first movie it's comic tone and had heated arguments with Ruben Flesicher on set to such an extent that filming halted for a few days. There were 3 script writers on the first movie can you guess who was one of them?It's the director of this movie who with her relationship strong armed and hijacked the plot elements and forced to introduce the comic tone into the first movie by reshooting the movie which had resulted in a disjointed mess.Even the Ruben had expressed his deep regrets about that but I guess if you can control the leading star you can have your way.If you closely look at the tone of the first movie first trailer you will notice the horror and science fiction elements present which had been stripped down to barebones and gag and quips reigned supreme.",Negative
590,"My wife and I watched Venom: The Last Dance (2024) last night in theaters. The storyline follows Eddie Brock, who is on the run from the law and hiding in Mexico. When an invasion from Venom's home world begins, Eddie must make his way to Area 51 to find reinforcements and fight off the invaders.Directed by Kelly Marcel in her directorial debut, the film stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Rhys Ifans (The Amazing Spider-Man), Stephen Graham (Snatch), and Juno Temple (Killer Joe).I absolutely loved the first two-thirds of this film. Tom Hardy nailed his role, bringing a perfect blend of humor, action, and Venom's signature appetite for chaos. The various forms Venom takes are visually entertaining, and the self-deprecating humor is spot-on. We especially enjoyed the introduction of a quirky ""hippie family,"" who added a fun twist. However, once the story shifts to Area 51, things feel rushed and forced. The other symbiotes look incredible, but they come and go so quickly that you're left wanting more. The villain's defeat also felt underwhelming, and I wanted a bit more depth in their storyline. The homage at the end felt somewhat awkward as well.In conclusion, Venom: The Last Dance is a fun watch and definitely worth seeing for fans of the character, though it doesn't quite reach its full potential. I'd rate it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Positive

592,"Venom 3 is fun movie. It will never be critically rated, but it doesn't need or try to be. It is fun, it is weird, it looks good and the interactions between Eddie and Venom are great as always and are funny unlike the forced jokes that don't always land. We get to see a bit more of the rest of the symbiotes, but it is not a major focus of the movie to introduce or highlight them, which was a bit disappointing personally. The storyline is a bit messy, and there are a few plotholes and illogical, unexplainable events, but the movie does a good job of actually taking the viewers through it. We get and ending to the trilogy that is pretty much what you expect, but the emotional charge of it feels a bit forced and doesn't let the viewer appreciate it for themselves. We also get a glimpse of what may come in the future, including a namedrop that comic fans will get, so we may see more of our goofy antihero in the future.",Positive
593,"Venom The Last Dance was hilarious, emotional and entertaining. Went in with the same expectations as before very low. I'm shocked about the critics, cause they expected much more unreal scenarios. Here again Sony is not stupid of course they'd have added a specific character in their world, but they probably can't because of a certain contract clause. The third movie is much better than the second cause the second movie suffered from extreme cuts which took out all its potential. Despite the fact that Venom was rumored and in productions ever since early 00s it's no wonder they made a trilogy and had box office success, cause Tom Hardy carried those movies on his own. Every other actor wouldn't be able to pull out this great chemistry between him and Venom. I'm not biased I see its flaws and weaknesses, but my God some critics thrashed this movie as if it's another Morbius or Madame Web. It's by far a better movie.The road trip family was adorable not necessary but there to add a more family atmosphere and emotional touch to this film. Juno Temple was good but underperformed and here background story was dragged into this movie.Ms Cheng was probably the best positive highlight of the movie besides the love for dogs and animals in general.A lot of great symbionts and designs were actually great to watch. I can't say much more to that point cause I want to avoid spoilers.The issuesThe plot and goal of the movie is clear but gets lost through the movie. The action sequences and CGI were average at best. I know that sounds awful for a higher rating, but hear me out. The cast was decent and some actors really shined here.Another problem is the camera work here too many fast cuts hardly to see specially when I think I was obligated to watch it in 3D. I prefer 2D.The biggest problem was there is no clear 1 v 1 villain here with heart and intentions. We have Knull as the big bad in the background but barely seen but only to bait us fans to watch it and another mystery character from the army or swat like crew not shown at all. Where as the first two movies had clear antagonists shown.Issue / or averageThe Ending was emotional and impactful with rushed bangs, but man there were some scenes I really felt touched by it. I still think they could've done more and Tom deserved more !I give it 6 but as a trilogy part and the Tom Hardy factor a light 7, cause reviews between 1-4 stars are harsh. And yeah don't leave there are two important post credit scenes. I'm really looking forward !",Positive

595,"Barely emotional. Barely funny. Barely mediocre. From this pattern, it can be deducted that Venom: The Last Dance is a passable movie that doesn't do enough right to feel like an epic send off, or do anything inherently wrong to be worth complaining about. It's just fine.Tom Hardy is once again the easy stand-out as Eddie Brock, using the same janky physical actions as Venom manipulates his movements to an entertaining degree. The humour is the same safe but fine lines of dialogue that either evoke a chuckle or short exhale of breath. The action scenes escalate in levels of excitement throughout the film, with the final act especially delivering some really fun mayhem. And being the supposed final film of the trilogy, there are some surprisingly tender moments sprinkled in, but aren't frequent enough to draw any real emotion.As aforementioned, the humour is fine but there's one particular segment of the film in Las Vegas that feels too ridiculous and reckless in the context of the movie. Moreover, the story sets up rules that either get contradicted, forgotten, or straight up ignored for the sake of 'cool' scenes. Aside from Eddie and Venom, the rest of the cast of characters come off as either underutilised, underdeveloped, or unnecessary. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rhys Ifans feel criminally wasted, Juno Temple and Clark Backo undermine each other as their characters could've been just compiled into one due to their similar traits, and Stephen Graham and Peggy Lu don't do much to feel properly utilised, especially Graham, who's character felt like was building up to a bigger pay-off than what we got. And the antagonist Knull was so sidelined that there's not much more to say about him other than 'he was in the movie'.In conclusion, for what Venom: The Last Dance can't deliver in a concise plot or compelling side characters, it manages to make up for it with fun symbiote action and mostly entertaining and semi-heartfelt sequences.",Negative
596,"Sony should publicly apologise to the audience for making this worst movie and make the audience suffer and wasted their time. So boring story, nothing to appreciate only actor (Tom Hardy) has done, good acting Else, everyone, not done anything to discuss, that's why am giving one star.Don't waste your money by going into the theatres. CGI was good, but story was so pathetic. You can just guess the whole picture by trailer waste of money. Tom Hardy should try superhero movies with other Studios sony is not good with superheroes. We have already seen this with Superman. Middle part was so boring and ending was too predictable.",Negative
597,"Venom: The Last Dance delivers exactly what it promises-an absurdly fun, high-octane ride with a surprising amount of heart. If you expected Avengers: Endgame level of finality, you walked into the wrong theater, but for those who wanted a dumb but entertaining alien-human bromance, this one's for you.This film is easily the best in the trilogy, blending sharp pacing, humor that actually lands, and action sequences that never feel forced. The weird yet charming dynamic between Eddie and Venom is in full swing, and the filmmakers know exactly how to tap into the ridiculous yet endearing relationship that has become the backbone of this series. It's self-aware without feeling desperate for laughs, striking a balance that's tough to nail in superhero movies these days.While some of the gore pushes the limits of PG-13, it's never gratuitous. There's enough bite to the violence to keep you hooked, but it stops short of being overwhelming. If anything, it adds a little edge to an otherwise slick, polished blockbuster.But the real kicker here is that, amidst all the chaos, Venom: The Last Dance sneaks in some genuine emotion. It's a film about keeping your best bro close, and somehow that works. So why all the hate? It's a popcorn flick that knows exactly what it is, and honestly, that's rare these days.",Positive
598,Almost the whole cast was full. The only cast members that helped was the family and of course the store lady. Mulligan was boring . I felt there was a power struggle when writing this. One wanted to show ase strong women yet made them look stupied and to emotional; while the other smart men but utterly useless in the long run causing more havoc and not thinking before moving.The CGI are as ok. The one creatures could have been way way more creative for sure.Over all it's a lack luster film unfortunately 😕..there's so much they could have done with Tom and this story line. We needed a version of him and Spider man yet have been robbed of that.,Negative
599,"First and foremost, it felt like the makers made every poor decision possible when it came to the sound tracks and music. That which is supposed to amplify the intensity of ride simply let it remain bland throughout, even the climax, even the falling action.With Venom and Eddie having largely ceased their bickering, their bromance has dwindled significantly in this movie. Being the conclusional piece of this hilarious trilogy, it has fallen short of many expectations.Of course there was some of those promised action as witnessed in the trailers. But was there something which swept me off my feet which was absent from the trailers? Not really.While the villain's back-story is rather solid, it could have been more centre-stage. Most of the characters that have made appearance in this movie felt weakly woven together; though the plot could not have moved forward without their roles, they barely left any impact. Speaking of the plot, it largely remains uneventful, with the makers just throwing a few name-sake 3D effect villainous creatures at our faces. There is only one major action sequence throughout the film, that it low-key has bottled down to something I would either skim through, or watch at a slightly increased playback speed.If the unnecessary scenes, and by that I mean, 'adding no humor or value to the plot' scenes were deleted, it could easily boil down to half its current run-time. That being said, there could definitely be leads from where this movie has left loose ends at, but presently, it stays far aloof from being involved in such a gifting.I feel like the last of the trilogy has not done justice to the previous two movies, it almost feels like watching a different character. The ending in particular came off to me as a tryhard terrific ending, and even if the clips were good, the track choices really did not work out for me.",Negative
600,"Eddie and Venom are on the run as fugitives after their battle with Carnage. They are chased by military force and aliens that want to capture them for their codex to unleash a greater evil in their world. Eddie and Venom venture out for a while avoiding authorities and the alien species.I am a fan of the first Venom movie. It is not a well-made movie, but it is so entertaining because of Tom Hardy's crazy performance in both roles and the wacky humor throughout the film. The second movie is much better made mainly because of Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris, but I actually enjoyed the first one more on a fun level. I was pretty excited for the third film and the trailers had me hooked. Does this trilogy end on a memorable last dance?I have mixed thoughts on Venom: The Last Dance. Let's start with the good. I love Eddie and Venom's dynamic and they are at their best in this movie. They have fun chemistry and banter and it feels like they are finally starting to get along with each other a bit better. They also have a few emotional moments that can come off as cheesy, but they have charm especially one scene where Eddie reassures Martin's son that his alien friend is there to help and Venom thanks the kid for a piece of chocolate. In a movie filled with silly moments and action-packed battles, it is a really sweet moment that shows how heroic Eddie and Venom have become.It helps that Tom Hardy is an absolute joy to watch. Hardy relishes in both of his roles and he never lets up. There are several moments of him doing stuff like going crazy at the slot machine and creating a drink at the bar by himself in a quick way. He also handles the more dramatic scenes very well making the more emotional moments work better than they should have.Also, Venom is a very cool character here. He is funny, his powers are awesome and he does anything to protect Eddie even knowing that if they are both alive the aliens will track them down because they have a codex. Venom's antics are very endearing and it seems like he just wants to join the fun and even tries to get Eddie to join in. I love watching him take control of other animals such as a horse, a fish and a frog. Venom is so much fun to watch and he is a good reason why I enjoy these movies despite their faults.The humor is for the most part pretty good. There is one gag that I cringed at but other than that, I got several laughs out of this movie. The banter between Eddie and Venom never gets old for me.The action scenes are pretty entertaining. The chase scene in the river is a standout because it looks cool, it has Eddie Brock defend himself without Venom and Venom turning into other creatures. It is also frenetic and fun to see play out. The climax is also big full of cool moments, but it is a little CGI heavy. However, it features Venom on a motorcycle again and it looks great. Overall, I enjoyed the action.The cinematography by Fabian Wagner is solid and colorful. The lighting is also on point with all of the scenes being lit well enough to see while having some flare in the shots. This is by far the best looking Venom movie filmmaking wise. The special effects are more polished and the alien creatures chasing Venom and Eddie look very menacing. Honestly, they kind of remind me of the Kaijus from Pacific Rim and I like that. There also other symbiotes in the film and they look very cool with their designs, but some of their colors blend in. The visuals are not perfect, but they are an upgrade from the last two movies.All that said, there are a few problems I have with this movie. The biggest problem is that the script is overstuffed. I know that there needs to other plot lines to have the story come together, but some of them do not work at all. The scientists subplot is one of the most boring parts of the movie with how slowly paced it is and how the tone shifts from fun to dreary and not the good kind of dreary. The subplot with Martin and his family is okay and has some great moments, but it can drag a little too long.The supporting cast does not hold a candle to Tom Hardy. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Rex Strickland is the best supporting performance, but his character is too unlikable to root for. Dr. Payne is kind of there until the climax. Clark Backo as Sadie Christmas is alright and she does a lot in the climax, but her character does not stand out until then. Rhys Ifans is having a lot of fun in his role as a family man who believes in aliens. While his family may have gotten a little more focus than they should have, Ifans is pretty fun to watch at times. Andy Serkis as Knull is absolutely wasted. He seems like a menacing villain, but he gets little to do aside from getting expository dialogue. By far, the weakest link in the film and wastes Andy Serkis on a limited role.The tone is all over the place. There are moments where this movie acts like a cheesy road trip comedy with Eddie and Venom and then the next scene could be overly serious research about the symbiotes. The movie progressively darker as it goes along and it has some moments that should come off as emotional and while they kind of work because of Tom Hardy's performance and the duo's likability, they feel a bit unearned because of how comedic this series is by now. When Eddie and Venom ponder the life they could have had when in the car with Martin's family, it is hard to feel anything because they have been two goofballs most of the time. Without spoiling anything, ending is a mixed bag for me because it is sad, but not a tearjerker like the movie wants it to be.The musical score by Dan Deacon makes no impression on me. It just sounds like generic music from any other movie. The needle drops are okay, but I wish they could find another song than Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. However, the credits song One Last Dance by Tom and Roman Morello and Grandson is really catchy and a great song to end the movie. Also, Maroon 5's Memories has a great needle drop here.Venom: The Last Dance is an entertaining movie. It is not well-made and not even as fun as the first film, but I overall had a pretty good time with the movie despite the many issues it has. I guess I cannot help but find Eddie and Venom a lot of fun to watch. Director Kelly Marcel did a great job with the scenes with those two and with the action scenes, but I think she bit off more than she could chew with the other subplots. If you like the Venom movies, you will probably enjoy this movie but if you never them then this movie will not change your mind.Stay through all of the credits.",Positive
601,"It is genuinely impressive that Sony managed to make the most mediocre trilogy ever with such an iconic character.In terms of enjoyment, Eddie and Venom continue to be a delightfully fun duo. In this 3rd movie, they are basically on a road trip and that was relatively entertaining for the most part. The final act of the movie was also a pretty enjoyable CGI action fest with some emotional scenes.However, the story and script are still as flat as ever. The narrative feels very half baked with it feeling like a chain of things just randomly happening. Pointless characters that don't add much. Jokes being thrown at you just to see which land. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor characters could have been played by anyone but feels purposely done because they knew fans recognised them from other Marvel projects. The villain Knull looks cool but is just there to be teased for future projects.Overall, it is better than the second film but just on par with the first. It is a mediocre final entry. Sony continues to disappoint with their universe and We all know Venom is coming back somehow. I do worry for Spiderman 4 and hope Sony don't mess that movie in anyway.",Neutral
602,"""Venom: The Last Dance' is a messy buddy road trip in which you must turn your brains off...again.Is it perfect? Nah, far from it. I think there are way too many storylines in here, and the main one got some potential, but it was wasted in typical Sony fashion. The ""Spider-Man 4"" rumors have been blown out of proportion in my opinion, so temper your expectations.The duo between Eddie and Venom is as fun as always. I mean Tom Hardy and the banter between them...I'm sorry, the banter between Hardy and himself is the best part of these movies (Hardy is doing the voice of Venom).The humor is there, but can't say I laughed all that much, beacause most of the jokes are base level childish again. It must be a bit more emotional as a whole, because supposedly is the last time we see Venom (hardly doubt), but it ends up kinda hollow.Knull is there...I guess, but will see how and when they'll use him again...it's Sony after all.It's a popcorn movie that reminds me of the early 2000's comic book movies. The action in the third act is good for the most parts and there are some funny moments here and there. Are there plot holes and some issues with the story? Yes. It's just another ""Turn your brains off"" Sony movie again.There are two credit scenes, first one is kinda important, the second one not so much.",Positive
603,"My relationship with the Venom franchise has been rocky. I have a soft spot for the first one, absolutely loathe the second, and now we come to the trilogy's closer, and thankfully, it's an improvement.Venom: The Last Dance works best when it focuses on Eddie and Venom's story instead of trying to set up the future of the Sonyverse. If you didn't like the previous Venom films, this won't change your mind. It's still messy, but it gets more right than its predecessors.This is easily the campiest and most mature of the bunch. It takes its time with the characters, letting us sit with them instead of rushing into the next action set piece. Still being PG-13 it manages to cram in a lot more gore than its predecessors. The action is inventive, and the humor hits its mark. It also doesn't shy away from getting personal and emotional. Eddie and Venom's relationship has never felt more genuine. I'll admit-I teared up a few times by the end.Some may be disappointed by the potrayal of Knull, but personally, I loved it. He feels like an overlooming threat rather than an one-off villain, and the ""God of Darkness"" gets a Thanos-esque treatment he deserves.Now, don't get me wrong-the movie is still bad, technically speaking-but it's self-aware about that. Instead of being ""bad bad,"" it chooses to be ""fun bad"" and entertain you, and I respect that. Not every movie needs to be great; sometimes being fun is enough.Even with the lows, I have always found a weird sense of comfort with this rendition of Venom. I have found myself caring more for these characters than maybe even the script intended. So I am happy to say that by the end, it does enough to justify this trilogy's existence - and to such an satisfying extent that I'd rather live in a world where the Venom movies exist than one where it doesn't.",Positive
604,"The third installment about the symbiotic anti-hero is a mix of bright moments and disappointments. Tom Hardy once again proves why he is the perfect choice for the role of Eddie Brock/Venom, but even his charismatic performance cannot save the unbalanced ensemble. The film starts off promisingly - with dynamic action and witty dialogue between Eddie and his symbiotic companion. Their relationship is still the best the series has to offer. Hardy brilliantly manages both comedic timing and dramatic moments. The visual effects are impressive in places, especially in the action sequences where Venom shows off his abilities. At other times, however, the CGI feels inadequate and more reminiscent of a video game from the last decade. Some fights are well choreographed, others are a chaotic mix of digital effects. The biggest problem is the script, which tries to be too ambitious. It mixes several storylines, introduces new characters and antagonists, but does not give them enough space to develop. The result is a rushed pace and superficial characters. The film's darker tone is a welcome change, but it often clashes with the comedic elements, creating an unbalanced whole. The film seems unsure whether it wants to be a serious drama or a lighthearted entertainment. Venom: The Last Dance is like a roller coaster - it's ups and downs. For fans of the series, it offers enough fun, but it's hard to call it a significant step forward. This film is like an average song on a great album, but as a whole it doesn't leave a strong impression. Fans will find their own, others may be disappointed.",Positive
605,"Maybe it's just because of my low expectations toward the series but it was just fun to watch. I've already lost hope for the trilogy to have a decent plot but I can say that this one has a better storyline than the second film.CGI was fine, I coudn't find any disturbing point. It was interesting to see the other symbiotes. I think those new symbiotes showed more symbiote-ish action scenes than venom when it comes to the fight ironically.There were a few funny jokes that made me laugh but I didn't really find Eddie's weird obsession for shoes funny, like was it supposed to be funny? Guess it was meant to be humor but well... it was almost tiring.",Neutral
606,"A solid enough send off for this 'Venom' trilogy.'Venom: The Last Dance' is decently amusing and produces enough entertainment with its plot. I didn't personally find it overly funny, though the person a few seats across from me had an absolute blast - never a bad thing seeing people enjoy themselves!Tom Hardy remains the key element of these films, they would be far less enjoyable without his presence. There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor stick out most from the other characters.",Negative

608,"Being Rated R probably would have saved this; I am just saying!This trilogy-capper almost makes me question if I have become more of a movie critic than a movie enjoyer. Then I remembered this is Sony's Spider-Man Universe we are talking about, which gave us films like ""Morbius"" and ""Madame Web."" I nonetheless went in here with an open mind, considering I do not mind the two previous ""Venom"" films that came out. After seeing ""The Last Dance,"" I question whether Sony was trying to set up their universe or give Eddie Brock and Venom the send-off they deserve. I am sadly leaning more toward the former.I should preface this review by telling you what I thought of the other two ""Venom"" films upon rewatch in preparation for this third installment. Those were entertaining yet disappointing superhero films saved by the performance of Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and Venom. The first was innocent enough, with a dull first and more engaging second half, a weak villain in Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake/Riot, exciting action, and Hardy performing nicely. Its sequel, ""Let There Be Carnage,"" surprisingly got better when revisiting it, easily surpassing its predecessor, with Hardy allowed to stretch his comedic abilities with Brock and Venom bickering hilariously. In addition, there is Woody Harrelson's enjoyable performance as Cletus Kasady/Carnage, who manages to rise above the flaws, including the disappointing inclusion of Naomie Harris' Frances Barrison/Shriek. Hardy was allowed to have fun with his characters, and the movies complimented him with a narrative that was not too complicated. The opposite is true for ""The Last Dance.""Let's get the positives out of the way first. It is a short list, which I am deeply saddened by, but I want to show you how it is not the worst superhero film out there or even the worst film of the year.Despite a woeful screenplay, Tom Hardy still does skillfully with Eddie Brock and Venom. He is not allowed to have as much fun as he did in the prior two films, but he is trying his best (right, the positives. Sorry).The rest of the cast delivered equally solid performances, with the other standout being Chiwetel Ejiofor as Orwell Taylor. Ejiofor always has a commanding presence whenever he is in a movie, with his characters of Baron Mordo in the two ""Doctor Strange"" films and Bathurst 2020 in the forgettable ""Infinite"" being the two I can think of at the top of my head. Even if the film is not the best, Ejiofor makes it work, and if it is fantastic, he always steals the show.The visual effects bring Venom and the other alien characters to gorgeous life. The other two ""Venom"" movies, granted, had remarkable CGI, but it is worth mentioning, specifically when discussing the positives.The action is somewhat fun. The ""Venom"" movies have always had enjoyable action. Unfortunately, ""The Last Dance"" was the least fun action-wise, but the first scene with action was sweet.The Venom symbiote is sometimes uniquely utilized. The trailers showcased Venom controlling a horse, and in the film, it is one of its best scenes. I am unsure if this is a spoiler, but he controls other animals, and they introduce other symbiotes, which is fun.I think that is it for the positives.I felt the portrayal of Eddie Brock and Venom this time was not good. Again, Hardy tried, but there were multiple times when it felt like he was bored. His character was, admittedly, bored at intervals, and Hardy is a screenwriter, but I am saying how it felt.The film tries to add new characters, but they are not compelling. The most obvious example is Dr. Payne, played by Juno Temple, who does nothing aside from believing that Brock is not a danger, while Ejiofor wants what is best for the world, considering the alien threat from Knull.Speaking of Knull, he was worse than Carlton Drake. He only sends alien minions to grab a MacGuffin that Venom has. I have not read the comics, but the impression I get from others and this movie is that Knull has a profound lore not represented here. Having Knull's alien pals and the Area 51 agents as the villains is too much, yet somehow too little.They also wasted Stephen Graham's Detective Mulligan. The trailers made it seem like Mulligan would be a principal and intriguing character. The only two interesting aspects about Mulligan are he has a symbiote and warns of Knull. That is it.Furthermore, it does not have that much comedy. ""Let There Be Carnage"" can easily be classified as a comedy, and I laughed more than I would like to admit. I think two laughs and three to five chuckles were all I had here. The film was not funny outside of the Venom horse and some banter between Brock and Venom.On top of that, there was not that much emotion. It is due to how much Brock and Venom were not well utilized and the clutter of characters. I did not care about the Area 51 personnel nor the unnamed family who brought Brock and Venom to Vegas. When the ending came along, which heightened the stakes to an unbelievable degree, I did not get emotional. It tried, but it failed to work.The other two ""Venom"" movies were entertaining, but this failed to come close. In an era where ""superhero fatigue"" is becoming more accepted, this trilogy-closer did not try anything new. Fascinating concepts here and there, and many standout scenes fail to save this disappointment in a franchise filled with them.Technically, a 6/10. Outside of the plot and the underwhelming screenplay, the visual effects remain exceptional, the actors did great, and the film functions.For the enjoyment score, I wanted to like this film. I had the sneaking suspicion that it might not work, but watching ""Let There Be Carnage"" increase in quality gave me hope. It was no ""Let There Be Carnage"" and is easily the weakest of the trilogy. It had the issues that plagued the likes of ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but does not come close to being as entertaining as them. I am so unhappy that the enjoyment score is a 4/10, but this trilogy deserved a better conclusion. Maybe it will get better when I watch it again, but as it stands, it is best for me to recommend you wait until Netflix or even Disney+.",Positive
609,"This movie was very middle of the road to me. Definitely better than the second one, but not as good as the original.I enjoyed the beginning very much. Nice pace, good story and funny at times. Also the last part was packed with action and it all looked amazing. Only thing I missed was some sort of a climax at the very end.The middle however, I did not care for too much. Some things felt forced, rushed and very unlikely. But as I often say in my reviews: 'It is a fictional, fantasy, action movie so who cares if some things do not add up.'As a whole I enjoyed it very much, Tom Hardy did not disappoint.",Positive
610,"I just don't get it, I thought the 1st Venom was good despite many fans may not have liked it. I'm not a comic fan, so for me it was good that they try to make it as relatable and realistic to just your average movie goer.The 2nd film was cringy and terrible in my opinion because the story didn't make much sense, too much drama, poetry, and bromance. I lost interest after watching that one but the trailer for this film looked good.Right from the beginning I realize this was going to be bad. I don't care about the multi-verse, I don't care about Knull, I don't care about all these comic lores. The story is completely unrelatable and the suspension of disbelief failed early on.And then to top it off, the ending was just awful.4/10 for the special effects. Everything else is a 0.",Negative
611,"If you've already come to terms with this version of Venom and Eddie Brock as more of a bromance than the savage, brutal duo from the comics, you're in for a fun ride, Venom: The Last Dance, the final chapter of the trilogy, delivers an entertaining ride with solid pacing, good performances, decent visual effects, and fun engaging enough story, added also with the joy of let all the madness fan service out makes Venom: The Last Dance an easy good time especially for me, even the serious part mostly with Chiwetel Ejiofor was executed pretty well, surprising wholesome moments with Rhys Ifans and his family characters, flawed? Sure, some of the editing cuts didn't quite work for me, there were a few cheesy, awkward moments that felt off, and nit picky here and there, overall, i have a good time with Venom: The Last Dance, and the most surprising thing also the least thing i could expect watching this supposed to be last time we'll see both Venom and Eddie was that i did get quite emotional at the end, it's clear they've evolved from mere host and symbiote to something much deeper, and their dynamic was surprisingly touching, my personal experience with these two also comes as long as these three movies together, and as the movie itself whether it's better than the first one which also a good movie in my opinion, The Last Dance succeeded my expectation from being far from bad, i want this goodbye to be at least watchable enough, and the result is more than that, Venom: The Last Dance is actually a good film, just like Venom would say, We are Venom, and this film makes sure we feel it.",Negative
612,"Fun, wild, and hot mess. There's too much plot that's never explained. Events just happen randomly with no payoff, with a big action scene towards the end. Eddie & Venom Bromance is the savior of this trilogy. If you enjoy the others you will enjoy this.Synopsis:
In Venom: The Last Dance, Tom Hardy returns as Venom, one of Marvel's greatest and most complex characters, for the final film in the trilogy. Eddie and Venom are on the run. Hunted by both of their worlds and with the net closing in, the duo are forced into a devastating decision that will bring the curtains down on Venom and Eddie's last dance.",Positive
613,"If you were hoping for a grand finale to the Venom franchise that would surpass the comedic heights of its predecessors, you're in for a letdown. While Venom: The Last Dance does deliver on the comedic front, it falls short in nearly every other aspect.The film picks up right where we left off, with Eddie Brock and Venom still on the run. The plot takes a convoluted turn as they become embroiled in a government conspiracy involving symbiotes and a dangerous threat to the universe. While the premise is intriguing, the execution feels rushed and often confusing.The real draw of this film, as with its predecessors, is the chemistry between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom. Their banter and witty exchanges provide much-needed humor and keep the film entertaining. However, the comedic elements can feel forced at times, and the overall tone can be uneven.The film's biggest flaw is its reliance on poor CGI and even worse dialogue. The visual effects, particularly those involving the titular symbiote, often feel like a step back from previous entries. Venom's appearances are fleeting, and when he does appear in full form, he's often overshadowed by lackluster animation.The script is equally disappointing. The story lacks depth and originality, and the characters feel one-dimensional. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the pacing feels uneven. While there are a few moments of humor that might elicit a chuckle, they're not enough to salvage the film.Ultimately, Venom: The Last Dance is a missed opportunity. It's a shame that such a potentially fun franchise has ended on such a sour note.",Negative
614,"If cinematic catastrophes could have a mascot, this would be standing at the front of the line, waving its tattered flag of mediocrity. Tom Hardy's final outing as Eddie Brock/Venom is not just a disappointment-it's an insult to audiences everywhere. To call this movie bad would be a kindness. This is an incoherent, muddled, and utterly joyless mess that somehow manages to fall short of even the lowest expectations.The premise of Eddie and Venom being ""on the run"" from both worlds promised at least some thrilling action. Instead, what we get is a chaotic, poorly-scripted nightmare of disjointed scenes and absurd plot holes big enough to swallow the entire Marvel universe. The narrative, if you can call it that, lurches forward with all the grace of a drunken man stumbling in the dark. There is no rhyme or reason to the events that unfold. It's like the writers cobbled together every half-baked idea they could think of and hoped nobody would notice how little sense any of it makes.The so-called ""devastating decision"" that Eddie and Venom face feels less like a culmination of their journey and more like a cheap, hollow ploy to yank on the audience's emotions. But even that attempt falls flat because, by the time it arrives, the viewer is too exhausted from enduring 90 minutes of mindless drivel to care.Eddie Brock, once a complex and conflicted anti-hero from the source comics, is reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self, mumbling and stumbling through the film like he just wants to get it over with.The supporting characters are even worse-if that's possible. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use cardboard cutouts of side characters nobody cares about and clearly has no understanding of what made the earlier films (barely) work.They serve no purpose other than to waste screen time and remind us that, yes, someone actually wrote this drivel down on paper.It wouldn't be a Venom movie without over-the-top CGI battles, right? Well, unfortunately, the action scenes here are so poorly executed and short to save cost that even those who came purely for mindless entertainment will leave disappointed. The special effects are a headache-inducing blur of dark, indistinguishable shapes smashing into each other, with zero sense of tension or creativity.The final fight scene feels like -an unintelligible swirl of chaos that is supposed to distract us from the fact that nothing of consequence is happening. It's not exciting, it's not entertaining, it's just ugly.At its core it tries to sell itself as a dramatic, emotional farewell to Eddie and Venom's bond, but it doesn't even come close to achieving that. Any attempt at emotional weight is drowned by the film's clumsy pacing and complete lack of character development. The so-called ""devastating"" decision feels unearned, forced, and utterly unconvincing. There is no sense of closure, no satisfying payoff-just a hollow, empty finale that leaves you wondering why you wasted your time in the first place.Avoid this movie like the symbiote plague it is. Eddie and Venom deserved better. We all deserved better.Tom's ego and nepotism to promote his FWB director both of whom had sole credit of writing the script should tell you that how much he actually despises the franchise.Tom was the ultimate culprit is giving the first movie it's comic tone and had heated arguments with Ruben Flesicher on set to such an extent that filming halted for a few days. There were 3 script writers on the first movie can you guess who was one of them?It's the director of this movie who with her relationship strong armed and hijacked the plot elements and forced to introduce the comic tone into the first movie by reshooting the movie which had resulted in a disjointed mess.Even the Ruben had expressed his deep regrets about that but I guess if you can control the leading star you can have your way.If you closely look at the tone of the first movie first trailer you will notice the horror and science fiction elements present which had been stripped down to barebones and gag and quips reigned supreme.",Negative
615,"My wife and I watched Venom: The Last Dance (2024) last night in theaters. The storyline follows Eddie Brock, who is on the run from the law and hiding in Mexico. When an invasion from Venom's home world begins, Eddie must make his way to Area 51 to find reinforcements and fight off the invaders.Directed by Kelly Marcel in her directorial debut, the film stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Rhys Ifans (The Amazing Spider-Man), Stephen Graham (Snatch), and Juno Temple (Killer Joe).I absolutely loved the first two-thirds of this film. Tom Hardy nailed his role, bringing a perfect blend of humor, action, and Venom's signature appetite for chaos. The various forms Venom takes are visually entertaining, and the self-deprecating humor is spot-on. We especially enjoyed the introduction of a quirky ""hippie family,"" who added a fun twist. However, once the story shifts to Area 51, things feel rushed and forced. The other symbiotes look incredible, but they come and go so quickly that you're left wanting more. The villain's defeat also felt underwhelming, and I wanted a bit more depth in their storyline. The homage at the end felt somewhat awkward as well.In conclusion, Venom: The Last Dance is a fun watch and definitely worth seeing for fans of the character, though it doesn't quite reach its full potential. I'd rate it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Positive

617,"Venom 3 is fun movie. It will never be critically rated, but it doesn't need or try to be. It is fun, it is weird, it looks good and the interactions between Eddie and Venom are great as always and are funny unlike the forced jokes that don't always land. We get to see a bit more of the rest of the symbiotes, but it is not a major focus of the movie to introduce or highlight them, which was a bit disappointing personally. The storyline is a bit messy, and there are a few plotholes and illogical, unexplainable events, but the movie does a good job of actually taking the viewers through it. We get and ending to the trilogy that is pretty much what you expect, but the emotional charge of it feels a bit forced and doesn't let the viewer appreciate it for themselves. We also get a glimpse of what may come in the future, including a namedrop that comic fans will get, so we may see more of our goofy antihero in the future.",Positive
618,"Venom The Last Dance was hilarious, emotional and entertaining. Went in with the same expectations as before very low. I'm shocked about the critics, cause they expected much more unreal scenarios. Here again Sony is not stupid of course they'd have added a specific character in their world, but they probably can't because of a certain contract clause. The third movie is much better than the second cause the second movie suffered from extreme cuts which took out all its potential. Despite the fact that Venom was rumored and in productions ever since early 00s it's no wonder they made a trilogy and had box office success, cause Tom Hardy carried those movies on his own. Every other actor wouldn't be able to pull out this great chemistry between him and Venom. I'm not biased I see its flaws and weaknesses, but my God some critics thrashed this movie as if it's another Morbius or Madame Web. It's by far a better movie.The road trip family was adorable not necessary but there to add a more family atmosphere and emotional touch to this film. Juno Temple was good but underperformed and here background story was dragged into this movie.Ms Cheng was probably the best positive highlight of the movie besides the love for dogs and animals in general.A lot of great symbionts and designs were actually great to watch. I can't say much more to that point cause I want to avoid spoilers.The issuesThe plot and goal of the movie is clear but gets lost through the movie. The action sequences and CGI were average at best. I know that sounds awful for a higher rating, but hear me out. The cast was decent and some actors really shined here.Another problem is the camera work here too many fast cuts hardly to see specially when I think I was obligated to watch it in 3D. I prefer 2D.The biggest problem was there is no clear 1 v 1 villain here with heart and intentions. We have Knull as the big bad in the background but barely seen but only to bait us fans to watch it and another mystery character from the army or swat like crew not shown at all. Where as the first two movies had clear antagonists shown.Issue / or averageThe Ending was emotional and impactful with rushed bangs, but man there were some scenes I really felt touched by it. I still think they could've done more and Tom deserved more !I give it 6 but as a trilogy part and the Tom Hardy factor a light 7, cause reviews between 1-4 stars are harsh. And yeah don't leave there are two important post credit scenes. I'm really looking forward !",Positive

620,"Barely emotional. Barely funny. Barely mediocre. From this pattern, it can be deducted that Venom: The Last Dance is a passable movie that doesn't do enough right to feel like an epic send off, or do anything inherently wrong to be worth complaining about. It's just fine.Tom Hardy is once again the easy stand-out as Eddie Brock, using the same janky physical actions as Venom manipulates his movements to an entertaining degree. The humour is the same safe but fine lines of dialogue that either evoke a chuckle or short exhale of breath. The action scenes escalate in levels of excitement throughout the film, with the final act especially delivering some really fun mayhem. And being the supposed final film of the trilogy, there are some surprisingly tender moments sprinkled in, but aren't frequent enough to draw any real emotion.As aforementioned, the humour is fine but there's one particular segment of the film in Las Vegas that feels too ridiculous and reckless in the context of the movie. Moreover, the story sets up rules that either get contradicted, forgotten, or straight up ignored for the sake of 'cool' scenes. Aside from Eddie and Venom, the rest of the cast of characters come off as either underutilised, underdeveloped, or unnecessary. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rhys Ifans feel criminally wasted, Juno Temple and Clark Backo undermine each other as their characters could've been just compiled into one due to their similar traits, and Stephen Graham and Peggy Lu don't do much to feel properly utilised, especially Graham, who's character felt like was building up to a bigger pay-off than what we got. And the antagonist Knull was so sidelined that there's not much more to say about him other than 'he was in the movie'.In conclusion, for what Venom: The Last Dance can't deliver in a concise plot or compelling side characters, it manages to make up for it with fun symbiote action and mostly entertaining and semi-heartfelt sequences.",Negative
621,"Sony should publicly apologise to the audience for making this worst movie and make the audience suffer and wasted their time. So boring story, nothing to appreciate only actor (Tom Hardy) has done, good acting Else, everyone, not done anything to discuss, that's why am giving one star.Don't waste your money by going into the theatres. CGI was good, but story was so pathetic. You can just guess the whole picture by trailer waste of money. Tom Hardy should try superhero movies with other Studios sony is not good with superheroes. We have already seen this with Superman. Middle part was so boring and ending was too predictable.",Negative
622,"Venom: The Last Dance delivers exactly what it promises-an absurdly fun, high-octane ride with a surprising amount of heart. If you expected Avengers: Endgame level of finality, you walked into the wrong theater, but for those who wanted a dumb but entertaining alien-human bromance, this one's for you.This film is easily the best in the trilogy, blending sharp pacing, humor that actually lands, and action sequences that never feel forced. The weird yet charming dynamic between Eddie and Venom is in full swing, and the filmmakers know exactly how to tap into the ridiculous yet endearing relationship that has become the backbone of this series. It's self-aware without feeling desperate for laughs, striking a balance that's tough to nail in superhero movies these days.While some of the gore pushes the limits of PG-13, it's never gratuitous. There's enough bite to the violence to keep you hooked, but it stops short of being overwhelming. If anything, it adds a little edge to an otherwise slick, polished blockbuster.But the real kicker here is that, amidst all the chaos, Venom: The Last Dance sneaks in some genuine emotion. It's a film about keeping your best bro close, and somehow that works. So why all the hate? It's a popcorn flick that knows exactly what it is, and honestly, that's rare these days.",Positive
623,Almost the whole cast was full. The only cast members that helped was the family and of course the store lady. Mulligan was boring . I felt there was a power struggle when writing this. One wanted to show ase strong women yet made them look stupied and to emotional; while the other smart men but utterly useless in the long run causing more havoc and not thinking before moving.The CGI are as ok. The one creatures could have been way way more creative for sure.Over all it's a lack luster film unfortunately 😕..there's so much they could have done with Tom and this story line. We needed a version of him and Spider man yet have been robbed of that.,Negative
624,"First and foremost, it felt like the makers made every poor decision possible when it came to the sound tracks and music. That which is supposed to amplify the intensity of ride simply let it remain bland throughout, even the climax, even the falling action.With Venom and Eddie having largely ceased their bickering, their bromance has dwindled significantly in this movie. Being the conclusional piece of this hilarious trilogy, it has fallen short of many expectations.Of course there was some of those promised action as witnessed in the trailers. But was there something which swept me off my feet which was absent from the trailers? Not really.While the villain's back-story is rather solid, it could have been more centre-stage. Most of the characters that have made appearance in this movie felt weakly woven together; though the plot could not have moved forward without their roles, they barely left any impact. Speaking of the plot, it largely remains uneventful, with the makers just throwing a few name-sake 3D effect villainous creatures at our faces. There is only one major action sequence throughout the film, that it low-key has bottled down to something I would either skim through, or watch at a slightly increased playback speed.If the unnecessary scenes, and by that I mean, 'adding no humor or value to the plot' scenes were deleted, it could easily boil down to half its current run-time. That being said, there could definitely be leads from where this movie has left loose ends at, but presently, it stays far aloof from being involved in such a gifting.I feel like the last of the trilogy has not done justice to the previous two movies, it almost feels like watching a different character. The ending in particular came off to me as a tryhard terrific ending, and even if the clips were good, the track choices really did not work out for me.",Negative
625,"Eddie and Venom are on the run as fugitives after their battle with Carnage. They are chased by military force and aliens that want to capture them for their codex to unleash a greater evil in their world. Eddie and Venom venture out for a while avoiding authorities and the alien species.I am a fan of the first Venom movie. It is not a well-made movie, but it is so entertaining because of Tom Hardy's crazy performance in both roles and the wacky humor throughout the film. The second movie is much better made mainly because of Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris, but I actually enjoyed the first one more on a fun level. I was pretty excited for the third film and the trailers had me hooked. Does this trilogy end on a memorable last dance?I have mixed thoughts on Venom: The Last Dance. Let's start with the good. I love Eddie and Venom's dynamic and they are at their best in this movie. They have fun chemistry and banter and it feels like they are finally starting to get along with each other a bit better. They also have a few emotional moments that can come off as cheesy, but they have charm especially one scene where Eddie reassures Martin's son that his alien friend is there to help and Venom thanks the kid for a piece of chocolate. In a movie filled with silly moments and action-packed battles, it is a really sweet moment that shows how heroic Eddie and Venom have become.It helps that Tom Hardy is an absolute joy to watch. Hardy relishes in both of his roles and he never lets up. There are several moments of him doing stuff like going crazy at the slot machine and creating a drink at the bar by himself in a quick way. He also handles the more dramatic scenes very well making the more emotional moments work better than they should have.Also, Venom is a very cool character here. He is funny, his powers are awesome and he does anything to protect Eddie even knowing that if they are both alive the aliens will track them down because they have a codex. Venom's antics are very endearing and it seems like he just wants to join the fun and even tries to get Eddie to join in. I love watching him take control of other animals such as a horse, a fish and a frog. Venom is so much fun to watch and he is a good reason why I enjoy these movies despite their faults.The humor is for the most part pretty good. There is one gag that I cringed at but other than that, I got several laughs out of this movie. The banter between Eddie and Venom never gets old for me.The action scenes are pretty entertaining. The chase scene in the river is a standout because it looks cool, it has Eddie Brock defend himself without Venom and Venom turning into other creatures. It is also frenetic and fun to see play out. The climax is also big full of cool moments, but it is a little CGI heavy. However, it features Venom on a motorcycle again and it looks great. Overall, I enjoyed the action.The cinematography by Fabian Wagner is solid and colorful. The lighting is also on point with all of the scenes being lit well enough to see while having some flare in the shots. This is by far the best looking Venom movie filmmaking wise. The special effects are more polished and the alien creatures chasing Venom and Eddie look very menacing. Honestly, they kind of remind me of the Kaijus from Pacific Rim and I like that. There also other symbiotes in the film and they look very cool with their designs, but some of their colors blend in. The visuals are not perfect, but they are an upgrade from the last two movies.All that said, there are a few problems I have with this movie. The biggest problem is that the script is overstuffed. I know that there needs to other plot lines to have the story come together, but some of them do not work at all. The scientists subplot is one of the most boring parts of the movie with how slowly paced it is and how the tone shifts from fun to dreary and not the good kind of dreary. The subplot with Martin and his family is okay and has some great moments, but it can drag a little too long.The supporting cast does not hold a candle to Tom Hardy. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Rex Strickland is the best supporting performance, but his character is too unlikable to root for. Dr. Payne is kind of there until the climax. Clark Backo as Sadie Christmas is alright and she does a lot in the climax, but her character does not stand out until then. Rhys Ifans is having a lot of fun in his role as a family man who believes in aliens. While his family may have gotten a little more focus than they should have, Ifans is pretty fun to watch at times. Andy Serkis as Knull is absolutely wasted. He seems like a menacing villain, but he gets little to do aside from getting expository dialogue. By far, the weakest link in the film and wastes Andy Serkis on a limited role.The tone is all over the place. There are moments where this movie acts like a cheesy road trip comedy with Eddie and Venom and then the next scene could be overly serious research about the symbiotes. The movie progressively darker as it goes along and it has some moments that should come off as emotional and while they kind of work because of Tom Hardy's performance and the duo's likability, they feel a bit unearned because of how comedic this series is by now. When Eddie and Venom ponder the life they could have had when in the car with Martin's family, it is hard to feel anything because they have been two goofballs most of the time. Without spoiling anything, ending is a mixed bag for me because it is sad, but not a tearjerker like the movie wants it to be.The musical score by Dan Deacon makes no impression on me. It just sounds like generic music from any other movie. The needle drops are okay, but I wish they could find another song than Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. However, the credits song One Last Dance by Tom and Roman Morello and Grandson is really catchy and a great song to end the movie. Also, Maroon 5's Memories has a great needle drop here.Venom: The Last Dance is an entertaining movie. It is not well-made and not even as fun as the first film, but I overall had a pretty good time with the movie despite the many issues it has. I guess I cannot help but find Eddie and Venom a lot of fun to watch. Director Kelly Marcel did a great job with the scenes with those two and with the action scenes, but I think she bit off more than she could chew with the other subplots. If you like the Venom movies, you will probably enjoy this movie but if you never them then this movie will not change your mind.Stay through all of the credits.",Positive
626,"It is genuinely impressive that Sony managed to make the most mediocre trilogy ever with such an iconic character.In terms of enjoyment, Eddie and Venom continue to be a delightfully fun duo. In this 3rd movie, they are basically on a road trip and that was relatively entertaining for the most part. The final act of the movie was also a pretty enjoyable CGI action fest with some emotional scenes.However, the story and script are still as flat as ever. The narrative feels very half baked with it feeling like a chain of things just randomly happening. Pointless characters that don't add much. Jokes being thrown at you just to see which land. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor characters could have been played by anyone but feels purposely done because they knew fans recognised them from other Marvel projects. The villain Knull looks cool but is just there to be teased for future projects.Overall, it is better than the second film but just on par with the first. It is a mediocre final entry. Sony continues to disappoint with their universe and We all know Venom is coming back somehow. I do worry for Spiderman 4 and hope Sony don't mess that movie in anyway.",Neutral
627,"""Venom: The Last Dance' is a messy buddy road trip in which you must turn your brains off...again.Is it perfect? Nah, far from it. I think there are way too many storylines in here, and the main one got some potential, but it was wasted in typical Sony fashion. The ""Spider-Man 4"" rumors have been blown out of proportion in my opinion, so temper your expectations.The duo between Eddie and Venom is as fun as always. I mean Tom Hardy and the banter between them...I'm sorry, the banter between Hardy and himself is the best part of these movies (Hardy is doing the voice of Venom).The humor is there, but can't say I laughed all that much, beacause most of the jokes are base level childish again. It must be a bit more emotional as a whole, because supposedly is the last time we see Venom (hardly doubt), but it ends up kinda hollow.Knull is there...I guess, but will see how and when they'll use him again...it's Sony after all.It's a popcorn movie that reminds me of the early 2000's comic book movies. The action in the third act is good for the most parts and there are some funny moments here and there. Are there plot holes and some issues with the story? Yes. It's just another ""Turn your brains off"" Sony movie again.There are two credit scenes, first one is kinda important, the second one not so much.",Positive
628,"My relationship with the Venom franchise has been rocky. I have a soft spot for the first one, absolutely loathe the second, and now we come to the trilogy's closer, and thankfully, it's an improvement.Venom: The Last Dance works best when it focuses on Eddie and Venom's story instead of trying to set up the future of the Sonyverse. If you didn't like the previous Venom films, this won't change your mind. It's still messy, but it gets more right than its predecessors.This is easily the campiest and most mature of the bunch. It takes its time with the characters, letting us sit with them instead of rushing into the next action set piece. Still being PG-13 it manages to cram in a lot more gore than its predecessors. The action is inventive, and the humor hits its mark. It also doesn't shy away from getting personal and emotional. Eddie and Venom's relationship has never felt more genuine. I'll admit-I teared up a few times by the end.Some may be disappointed by the potrayal of Knull, but personally, I loved it. He feels like an overlooming threat rather than an one-off villain, and the ""God of Darkness"" gets a Thanos-esque treatment he deserves.Now, don't get me wrong-the movie is still bad, technically speaking-but it's self-aware about that. Instead of being ""bad bad,"" it chooses to be ""fun bad"" and entertain you, and I respect that. Not every movie needs to be great; sometimes being fun is enough.Even with the lows, I have always found a weird sense of comfort with this rendition of Venom. I have found myself caring more for these characters than maybe even the script intended. So I am happy to say that by the end, it does enough to justify this trilogy's existence - and to such an satisfying extent that I'd rather live in a world where the Venom movies exist than one where it doesn't.",Positive
629,"The third installment about the symbiotic anti-hero is a mix of bright moments and disappointments. Tom Hardy once again proves why he is the perfect choice for the role of Eddie Brock/Venom, but even his charismatic performance cannot save the unbalanced ensemble. The film starts off promisingly - with dynamic action and witty dialogue between Eddie and his symbiotic companion. Their relationship is still the best the series has to offer. Hardy brilliantly manages both comedic timing and dramatic moments. The visual effects are impressive in places, especially in the action sequences where Venom shows off his abilities. At other times, however, the CGI feels inadequate and more reminiscent of a video game from the last decade. Some fights are well choreographed, others are a chaotic mix of digital effects. The biggest problem is the script, which tries to be too ambitious. It mixes several storylines, introduces new characters and antagonists, but does not give them enough space to develop. The result is a rushed pace and superficial characters. The film's darker tone is a welcome change, but it often clashes with the comedic elements, creating an unbalanced whole. The film seems unsure whether it wants to be a serious drama or a lighthearted entertainment. Venom: The Last Dance is like a roller coaster - it's ups and downs. For fans of the series, it offers enough fun, but it's hard to call it a significant step forward. This film is like an average song on a great album, but as a whole it doesn't leave a strong impression. Fans will find their own, others may be disappointed.",Positive
630,"Maybe it's just because of my low expectations toward the series but it was just fun to watch. I've already lost hope for the trilogy to have a decent plot but I can say that this one has a better storyline than the second film.CGI was fine, I coudn't find any disturbing point. It was interesting to see the other symbiotes. I think those new symbiotes showed more symbiote-ish action scenes than venom when it comes to the fight ironically.There were a few funny jokes that made me laugh but I didn't really find Eddie's weird obsession for shoes funny, like was it supposed to be funny? Guess it was meant to be humor but well... it was almost tiring.",Neutral
631,"A solid enough send off for this 'Venom' trilogy.'Venom: The Last Dance' is decently amusing and produces enough entertainment with its plot. I didn't personally find it overly funny, though the person a few seats across from me had an absolute blast - never a bad thing seeing people enjoy themselves!Tom Hardy remains the key element of these films, they would be far less enjoyable without his presence. There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor stick out most from the other characters.",Negative

633,"Being Rated R probably would have saved this; I am just saying!This trilogy-capper almost makes me question if I have become more of a movie critic than a movie enjoyer. Then I remembered this is Sony's Spider-Man Universe we are talking about, which gave us films like ""Morbius"" and ""Madame Web."" I nonetheless went in here with an open mind, considering I do not mind the two previous ""Venom"" films that came out. After seeing ""The Last Dance,"" I question whether Sony was trying to set up their universe or give Eddie Brock and Venom the send-off they deserve. I am sadly leaning more toward the former.I should preface this review by telling you what I thought of the other two ""Venom"" films upon rewatch in preparation for this third installment. Those were entertaining yet disappointing superhero films saved by the performance of Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and Venom. The first was innocent enough, with a dull first and more engaging second half, a weak villain in Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake/Riot, exciting action, and Hardy performing nicely. Its sequel, ""Let There Be Carnage,"" surprisingly got better when revisiting it, easily surpassing its predecessor, with Hardy allowed to stretch his comedic abilities with Brock and Venom bickering hilariously. In addition, there is Woody Harrelson's enjoyable performance as Cletus Kasady/Carnage, who manages to rise above the flaws, including the disappointing inclusion of Naomie Harris' Frances Barrison/Shriek. Hardy was allowed to have fun with his characters, and the movies complimented him with a narrative that was not too complicated. The opposite is true for ""The Last Dance.""Let's get the positives out of the way first. It is a short list, which I am deeply saddened by, but I want to show you how it is not the worst superhero film out there or even the worst film of the year.Despite a woeful screenplay, Tom Hardy still does skillfully with Eddie Brock and Venom. He is not allowed to have as much fun as he did in the prior two films, but he is trying his best (right, the positives. Sorry).The rest of the cast delivered equally solid performances, with the other standout being Chiwetel Ejiofor as Orwell Taylor. Ejiofor always has a commanding presence whenever he is in a movie, with his characters of Baron Mordo in the two ""Doctor Strange"" films and Bathurst 2020 in the forgettable ""Infinite"" being the two I can think of at the top of my head. Even if the film is not the best, Ejiofor makes it work, and if it is fantastic, he always steals the show.The visual effects bring Venom and the other alien characters to gorgeous life. The other two ""Venom"" movies, granted, had remarkable CGI, but it is worth mentioning, specifically when discussing the positives.The action is somewhat fun. The ""Venom"" movies have always had enjoyable action. Unfortunately, ""The Last Dance"" was the least fun action-wise, but the first scene with action was sweet.The Venom symbiote is sometimes uniquely utilized. The trailers showcased Venom controlling a horse, and in the film, it is one of its best scenes. I am unsure if this is a spoiler, but he controls other animals, and they introduce other symbiotes, which is fun.I think that is it for the positives.I felt the portrayal of Eddie Brock and Venom this time was not good. Again, Hardy tried, but there were multiple times when it felt like he was bored. His character was, admittedly, bored at intervals, and Hardy is a screenwriter, but I am saying how it felt.The film tries to add new characters, but they are not compelling. The most obvious example is Dr. Payne, played by Juno Temple, who does nothing aside from believing that Brock is not a danger, while Ejiofor wants what is best for the world, considering the alien threat from Knull.Speaking of Knull, he was worse than Carlton Drake. He only sends alien minions to grab a MacGuffin that Venom has. I have not read the comics, but the impression I get from others and this movie is that Knull has a profound lore not represented here. Having Knull's alien pals and the Area 51 agents as the villains is too much, yet somehow too little.They also wasted Stephen Graham's Detective Mulligan. The trailers made it seem like Mulligan would be a principal and intriguing character. The only two interesting aspects about Mulligan are he has a symbiote and warns of Knull. That is it.Furthermore, it does not have that much comedy. ""Let There Be Carnage"" can easily be classified as a comedy, and I laughed more than I would like to admit. I think two laughs and three to five chuckles were all I had here. The film was not funny outside of the Venom horse and some banter between Brock and Venom.On top of that, there was not that much emotion. It is due to how much Brock and Venom were not well utilized and the clutter of characters. I did not care about the Area 51 personnel nor the unnamed family who brought Brock and Venom to Vegas. When the ending came along, which heightened the stakes to an unbelievable degree, I did not get emotional. It tried, but it failed to work.The other two ""Venom"" movies were entertaining, but this failed to come close. In an era where ""superhero fatigue"" is becoming more accepted, this trilogy-closer did not try anything new. Fascinating concepts here and there, and many standout scenes fail to save this disappointment in a franchise filled with them.Technically, a 6/10. Outside of the plot and the underwhelming screenplay, the visual effects remain exceptional, the actors did great, and the film functions.For the enjoyment score, I wanted to like this film. I had the sneaking suspicion that it might not work, but watching ""Let There Be Carnage"" increase in quality gave me hope. It was no ""Let There Be Carnage"" and is easily the weakest of the trilogy. It had the issues that plagued the likes of ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but does not come close to being as entertaining as them. I am so unhappy that the enjoyment score is a 4/10, but this trilogy deserved a better conclusion. Maybe it will get better when I watch it again, but as it stands, it is best for me to recommend you wait until Netflix or even Disney+.",Positive
634,"This movie was very middle of the road to me. Definitely better than the second one, but not as good as the original.I enjoyed the beginning very much. Nice pace, good story and funny at times. Also the last part was packed with action and it all looked amazing. Only thing I missed was some sort of a climax at the very end.The middle however, I did not care for too much. Some things felt forced, rushed and very unlikely. But as I often say in my reviews: 'It is a fictional, fantasy, action movie so who cares if some things do not add up.'As a whole I enjoyed it very much, Tom Hardy did not disappoint.",Positive
635,"I just don't get it, I thought the 1st Venom was good despite many fans may not have liked it. I'm not a comic fan, so for me it was good that they try to make it as relatable and realistic to just your average movie goer.The 2nd film was cringy and terrible in my opinion because the story didn't make much sense, too much drama, poetry, and bromance. I lost interest after watching that one but the trailer for this film looked good.Right from the beginning I realize this was going to be bad. I don't care about the multi-verse, I don't care about Knull, I don't care about all these comic lores. The story is completely unrelatable and the suspension of disbelief failed early on.And then to top it off, the ending was just awful.4/10 for the special effects. Everything else is a 0.",Negative
636,"If you've already come to terms with this version of Venom and Eddie Brock as more of a bromance than the savage, brutal duo from the comics, you're in for a fun ride, Venom: The Last Dance, the final chapter of the trilogy, delivers an entertaining ride with solid pacing, good performances, decent visual effects, and fun engaging enough story, added also with the joy of let all the madness fan service out makes Venom: The Last Dance an easy good time especially for me, even the serious part mostly with Chiwetel Ejiofor was executed pretty well, surprising wholesome moments with Rhys Ifans and his family characters, flawed? Sure, some of the editing cuts didn't quite work for me, there were a few cheesy, awkward moments that felt off, and nit picky here and there, overall, i have a good time with Venom: The Last Dance, and the most surprising thing also the least thing i could expect watching this supposed to be last time we'll see both Venom and Eddie was that i did get quite emotional at the end, it's clear they've evolved from mere host and symbiote to something much deeper, and their dynamic was surprisingly touching, my personal experience with these two also comes as long as these three movies together, and as the movie itself whether it's better than the first one which also a good movie in my opinion, The Last Dance succeeded my expectation from being far from bad, i want this goodbye to be at least watchable enough, and the result is more than that, Venom: The Last Dance is actually a good film, just like Venom would say, We are Venom, and this film makes sure we feel it.",Negative

638,"If you were hoping for a grand finale to the Venom franchise that would surpass the comedic heights of its predecessors, you're in for a letdown. While Venom: The Last Dance does deliver on the comedic front, it falls short in nearly every other aspect.The film picks up right where we left off, with Eddie Brock and Venom still on the run. The plot takes a convoluted turn as they become embroiled in a government conspiracy involving symbiotes and a dangerous threat to the universe. While the premise is intriguing, the execution feels rushed and often confusing.The real draw of this film, as with its predecessors, is the chemistry between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom. Their banter and witty exchanges provide much-needed humor and keep the film entertaining. However, the comedic elements can feel forced at times, and the overall tone can be uneven.The film's biggest flaw is its reliance on poor CGI and even worse dialogue. The visual effects, particularly those involving the titular symbiote, often feel like a step back from previous entries. Venom's appearances are fleeting, and when he does appear in full form, he's often overshadowed by lackluster animation.The script is equally disappointing. The story lacks depth and originality, and the characters feel one-dimensional. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the pacing feels uneven. While there are a few moments of humor that might elicit a chuckle, they're not enough to salvage the film.Ultimately, Venom: The Last Dance is a missed opportunity. It's a shame that such a potentially fun franchise has ended on such a sour note.",Negative
639,"If cinematic catastrophes could have a mascot, this would be standing at the front of the line, waving its tattered flag of mediocrity. Tom Hardy's final outing as Eddie Brock/Venom is not just a disappointment-it's an insult to audiences everywhere. To call this movie bad would be a kindness. This is an incoherent, muddled, and utterly joyless mess that somehow manages to fall short of even the lowest expectations.The premise of Eddie and Venom being ""on the run"" from both worlds promised at least some thrilling action. Instead, what we get is a chaotic, poorly-scripted nightmare of disjointed scenes and absurd plot holes big enough to swallow the entire Marvel universe. The narrative, if you can call it that, lurches forward with all the grace of a drunken man stumbling in the dark. There is no rhyme or reason to the events that unfold. It's like the writers cobbled together every half-baked idea they could think of and hoped nobody would notice how little sense any of it makes.The so-called ""devastating decision"" that Eddie and Venom face feels less like a culmination of their journey and more like a cheap, hollow ploy to yank on the audience's emotions. But even that attempt falls flat because, by the time it arrives, the viewer is too exhausted from enduring 90 minutes of mindless drivel to care.Eddie Brock, once a complex and conflicted anti-hero from the source comics, is reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self, mumbling and stumbling through the film like he just wants to get it over with.The supporting characters are even worse-if that's possible. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use cardboard cutouts of side characters nobody cares about and clearly has no understanding of what made the earlier films (barely) work.They serve no purpose other than to waste screen time and remind us that, yes, someone actually wrote this drivel down on paper.It wouldn't be a Venom movie without over-the-top CGI battles, right? Well, unfortunately, the action scenes here are so poorly executed and short to save cost that even those who came purely for mindless entertainment will leave disappointed. The special effects are a headache-inducing blur of dark, indistinguishable shapes smashing into each other, with zero sense of tension or creativity.The final fight scene feels like -an unintelligible swirl of chaos that is supposed to distract us from the fact that nothing of consequence is happening. It's not exciting, it's not entertaining, it's just ugly.At its core it tries to sell itself as a dramatic, emotional farewell to Eddie and Venom's bond, but it doesn't even come close to achieving that. Any attempt at emotional weight is drowned by the film's clumsy pacing and complete lack of character development. The so-called ""devastating"" decision feels unearned, forced, and utterly unconvincing. There is no sense of closure, no satisfying payoff-just a hollow, empty finale that leaves you wondering why you wasted your time in the first place.Avoid this movie like the symbiote plague it is. Eddie and Venom deserved better. We all deserved better.Tom's ego and nepotism to promote his FWB director both of whom had sole credit of writing the script should tell you that how much he actually despises the franchise.Tom was the ultimate culprit is giving the first movie it's comic tone and had heated arguments with Ruben Flesicher on set to such an extent that filming halted for a few days. There were 3 script writers on the first movie can you guess who was one of them?It's the director of this movie who with her relationship strong armed and hijacked the plot elements and forced to introduce the comic tone into the first movie by reshooting the movie which had resulted in a disjointed mess.Even the Ruben had expressed his deep regrets about that but I guess if you can control the leading star you can have your way.If you closely look at the tone of the first movie first trailer you will notice the horror and science fiction elements present which had been stripped down to barebones and gag and quips reigned supreme.",Negative
640,"My wife and I watched Venom: The Last Dance (2024) last night in theaters. The storyline follows Eddie Brock, who is on the run from the law and hiding in Mexico. When an invasion from Venom's home world begins, Eddie must make his way to Area 51 to find reinforcements and fight off the invaders.Directed by Kelly Marcel in her directorial debut, the film stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Rhys Ifans (The Amazing Spider-Man), Stephen Graham (Snatch), and Juno Temple (Killer Joe).I absolutely loved the first two-thirds of this film. Tom Hardy nailed his role, bringing a perfect blend of humor, action, and Venom's signature appetite for chaos. The various forms Venom takes are visually entertaining, and the self-deprecating humor is spot-on. We especially enjoyed the introduction of a quirky ""hippie family,"" who added a fun twist. However, once the story shifts to Area 51, things feel rushed and forced. The other symbiotes look incredible, but they come and go so quickly that you're left wanting more. The villain's defeat also felt underwhelming, and I wanted a bit more depth in their storyline. The homage at the end felt somewhat awkward as well.In conclusion, Venom: The Last Dance is a fun watch and definitely worth seeing for fans of the character, though it doesn't quite reach its full potential. I'd rate it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Positive

642,"Venom 3 is fun movie. It will never be critically rated, but it doesn't need or try to be. It is fun, it is weird, it looks good and the interactions between Eddie and Venom are great as always and are funny unlike the forced jokes that don't always land. We get to see a bit more of the rest of the symbiotes, but it is not a major focus of the movie to introduce or highlight them, which was a bit disappointing personally. The storyline is a bit messy, and there are a few plotholes and illogical, unexplainable events, but the movie does a good job of actually taking the viewers through it. We get and ending to the trilogy that is pretty much what you expect, but the emotional charge of it feels a bit forced and doesn't let the viewer appreciate it for themselves. We also get a glimpse of what may come in the future, including a namedrop that comic fans will get, so we may see more of our goofy antihero in the future.",Positive
643,"Venom The Last Dance was hilarious, emotional and entertaining. Went in with the same expectations as before very low. I'm shocked about the critics, cause they expected much more unreal scenarios. Here again Sony is not stupid of course they'd have added a specific character in their world, but they probably can't because of a certain contract clause. The third movie is much better than the second cause the second movie suffered from extreme cuts which took out all its potential. Despite the fact that Venom was rumored and in productions ever since early 00s it's no wonder they made a trilogy and had box office success, cause Tom Hardy carried those movies on his own. Every other actor wouldn't be able to pull out this great chemistry between him and Venom. I'm not biased I see its flaws and weaknesses, but my God some critics thrashed this movie as if it's another Morbius or Madame Web. It's by far a better movie.The road trip family was adorable not necessary but there to add a more family atmosphere and emotional touch to this film. Juno Temple was good but underperformed and here background story was dragged into this movie.Ms Cheng was probably the best positive highlight of the movie besides the love for dogs and animals in general.A lot of great symbionts and designs were actually great to watch. I can't say much more to that point cause I want to avoid spoilers.The issuesThe plot and goal of the movie is clear but gets lost through the movie. The action sequences and CGI were average at best. I know that sounds awful for a higher rating, but hear me out. The cast was decent and some actors really shined here.Another problem is the camera work here too many fast cuts hardly to see specially when I think I was obligated to watch it in 3D. I prefer 2D.The biggest problem was there is no clear 1 v 1 villain here with heart and intentions. We have Knull as the big bad in the background but barely seen but only to bait us fans to watch it and another mystery character from the army or swat like crew not shown at all. Where as the first two movies had clear antagonists shown.Issue / or averageThe Ending was emotional and impactful with rushed bangs, but man there were some scenes I really felt touched by it. I still think they could've done more and Tom deserved more !I give it 6 but as a trilogy part and the Tom Hardy factor a light 7, cause reviews between 1-4 stars are harsh. And yeah don't leave there are two important post credit scenes. I'm really looking forward !",Positive

645,"Barely emotional. Barely funny. Barely mediocre. From this pattern, it can be deducted that Venom: The Last Dance is a passable movie that doesn't do enough right to feel like an epic send off, or do anything inherently wrong to be worth complaining about. It's just fine.Tom Hardy is once again the easy stand-out as Eddie Brock, using the same janky physical actions as Venom manipulates his movements to an entertaining degree. The humour is the same safe but fine lines of dialogue that either evoke a chuckle or short exhale of breath. The action scenes escalate in levels of excitement throughout the film, with the final act especially delivering some really fun mayhem. And being the supposed final film of the trilogy, there are some surprisingly tender moments sprinkled in, but aren't frequent enough to draw any real emotion.As aforementioned, the humour is fine but there's one particular segment of the film in Las Vegas that feels too ridiculous and reckless in the context of the movie. Moreover, the story sets up rules that either get contradicted, forgotten, or straight up ignored for the sake of 'cool' scenes. Aside from Eddie and Venom, the rest of the cast of characters come off as either underutilised, underdeveloped, or unnecessary. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rhys Ifans feel criminally wasted, Juno Temple and Clark Backo undermine each other as their characters could've been just compiled into one due to their similar traits, and Stephen Graham and Peggy Lu don't do much to feel properly utilised, especially Graham, who's character felt like was building up to a bigger pay-off than what we got. And the antagonist Knull was so sidelined that there's not much more to say about him other than 'he was in the movie'.In conclusion, for what Venom: The Last Dance can't deliver in a concise plot or compelling side characters, it manages to make up for it with fun symbiote action and mostly entertaining and semi-heartfelt sequences.",Negative
646,"Sony should publicly apologise to the audience for making this worst movie and make the audience suffer and wasted their time. So boring story, nothing to appreciate only actor (Tom Hardy) has done, good acting Else, everyone, not done anything to discuss, that's why am giving one star.Don't waste your money by going into the theatres. CGI was good, but story was so pathetic. You can just guess the whole picture by trailer waste of money. Tom Hardy should try superhero movies with other Studios sony is not good with superheroes. We have already seen this with Superman. Middle part was so boring and ending was too predictable.",Negative
647,"Venom: The Last Dance delivers exactly what it promises-an absurdly fun, high-octane ride with a surprising amount of heart. If you expected Avengers: Endgame level of finality, you walked into the wrong theater, but for those who wanted a dumb but entertaining alien-human bromance, this one's for you.This film is easily the best in the trilogy, blending sharp pacing, humor that actually lands, and action sequences that never feel forced. The weird yet charming dynamic between Eddie and Venom is in full swing, and the filmmakers know exactly how to tap into the ridiculous yet endearing relationship that has become the backbone of this series. It's self-aware without feeling desperate for laughs, striking a balance that's tough to nail in superhero movies these days.While some of the gore pushes the limits of PG-13, it's never gratuitous. There's enough bite to the violence to keep you hooked, but it stops short of being overwhelming. If anything, it adds a little edge to an otherwise slick, polished blockbuster.But the real kicker here is that, amidst all the chaos, Venom: The Last Dance sneaks in some genuine emotion. It's a film about keeping your best bro close, and somehow that works. So why all the hate? It's a popcorn flick that knows exactly what it is, and honestly, that's rare these days.",Positive
648,Almost the whole cast was full. The only cast members that helped was the family and of course the store lady. Mulligan was boring . I felt there was a power struggle when writing this. One wanted to show ase strong women yet made them look stupied and to emotional; while the other smart men but utterly useless in the long run causing more havoc and not thinking before moving.The CGI are as ok. The one creatures could have been way way more creative for sure.Over all it's a lack luster film unfortunately 😕..there's so much they could have done with Tom and this story line. We needed a version of him and Spider man yet have been robbed of that.,Negative
649,"First and foremost, it felt like the makers made every poor decision possible when it came to the sound tracks and music. That which is supposed to amplify the intensity of ride simply let it remain bland throughout, even the climax, even the falling action.With Venom and Eddie having largely ceased their bickering, their bromance has dwindled significantly in this movie. Being the conclusional piece of this hilarious trilogy, it has fallen short of many expectations.Of course there was some of those promised action as witnessed in the trailers. But was there something which swept me off my feet which was absent from the trailers? Not really.While the villain's back-story is rather solid, it could have been more centre-stage. Most of the characters that have made appearance in this movie felt weakly woven together; though the plot could not have moved forward without their roles, they barely left any impact. Speaking of the plot, it largely remains uneventful, with the makers just throwing a few name-sake 3D effect villainous creatures at our faces. There is only one major action sequence throughout the film, that it low-key has bottled down to something I would either skim through, or watch at a slightly increased playback speed.If the unnecessary scenes, and by that I mean, 'adding no humor or value to the plot' scenes were deleted, it could easily boil down to half its current run-time. That being said, there could definitely be leads from where this movie has left loose ends at, but presently, it stays far aloof from being involved in such a gifting.I feel like the last of the trilogy has not done justice to the previous two movies, it almost feels like watching a different character. The ending in particular came off to me as a tryhard terrific ending, and even if the clips were good, the track choices really did not work out for me.",Negative
650,"Eddie and Venom are on the run as fugitives after their battle with Carnage. They are chased by military force and aliens that want to capture them for their codex to unleash a greater evil in their world. Eddie and Venom venture out for a while avoiding authorities and the alien species.I am a fan of the first Venom movie. It is not a well-made movie, but it is so entertaining because of Tom Hardy's crazy performance in both roles and the wacky humor throughout the film. The second movie is much better made mainly because of Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris, but I actually enjoyed the first one more on a fun level. I was pretty excited for the third film and the trailers had me hooked. Does this trilogy end on a memorable last dance?I have mixed thoughts on Venom: The Last Dance. Let's start with the good. I love Eddie and Venom's dynamic and they are at their best in this movie. They have fun chemistry and banter and it feels like they are finally starting to get along with each other a bit better. They also have a few emotional moments that can come off as cheesy, but they have charm especially one scene where Eddie reassures Martin's son that his alien friend is there to help and Venom thanks the kid for a piece of chocolate. In a movie filled with silly moments and action-packed battles, it is a really sweet moment that shows how heroic Eddie and Venom have become.It helps that Tom Hardy is an absolute joy to watch. Hardy relishes in both of his roles and he never lets up. There are several moments of him doing stuff like going crazy at the slot machine and creating a drink at the bar by himself in a quick way. He also handles the more dramatic scenes very well making the more emotional moments work better than they should have.Also, Venom is a very cool character here. He is funny, his powers are awesome and he does anything to protect Eddie even knowing that if they are both alive the aliens will track them down because they have a codex. Venom's antics are very endearing and it seems like he just wants to join the fun and even tries to get Eddie to join in. I love watching him take control of other animals such as a horse, a fish and a frog. Venom is so much fun to watch and he is a good reason why I enjoy these movies despite their faults.The humor is for the most part pretty good. There is one gag that I cringed at but other than that, I got several laughs out of this movie. The banter between Eddie and Venom never gets old for me.The action scenes are pretty entertaining. The chase scene in the river is a standout because it looks cool, it has Eddie Brock defend himself without Venom and Venom turning into other creatures. It is also frenetic and fun to see play out. The climax is also big full of cool moments, but it is a little CGI heavy. However, it features Venom on a motorcycle again and it looks great. Overall, I enjoyed the action.The cinematography by Fabian Wagner is solid and colorful. The lighting is also on point with all of the scenes being lit well enough to see while having some flare in the shots. This is by far the best looking Venom movie filmmaking wise. The special effects are more polished and the alien creatures chasing Venom and Eddie look very menacing. Honestly, they kind of remind me of the Kaijus from Pacific Rim and I like that. There also other symbiotes in the film and they look very cool with their designs, but some of their colors blend in. The visuals are not perfect, but they are an upgrade from the last two movies.All that said, there are a few problems I have with this movie. The biggest problem is that the script is overstuffed. I know that there needs to other plot lines to have the story come together, but some of them do not work at all. The scientists subplot is one of the most boring parts of the movie with how slowly paced it is and how the tone shifts from fun to dreary and not the good kind of dreary. The subplot with Martin and his family is okay and has some great moments, but it can drag a little too long.The supporting cast does not hold a candle to Tom Hardy. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Rex Strickland is the best supporting performance, but his character is too unlikable to root for. Dr. Payne is kind of there until the climax. Clark Backo as Sadie Christmas is alright and she does a lot in the climax, but her character does not stand out until then. Rhys Ifans is having a lot of fun in his role as a family man who believes in aliens. While his family may have gotten a little more focus than they should have, Ifans is pretty fun to watch at times. Andy Serkis as Knull is absolutely wasted. He seems like a menacing villain, but he gets little to do aside from getting expository dialogue. By far, the weakest link in the film and wastes Andy Serkis on a limited role.The tone is all over the place. There are moments where this movie acts like a cheesy road trip comedy with Eddie and Venom and then the next scene could be overly serious research about the symbiotes. The movie progressively darker as it goes along and it has some moments that should come off as emotional and while they kind of work because of Tom Hardy's performance and the duo's likability, they feel a bit unearned because of how comedic this series is by now. When Eddie and Venom ponder the life they could have had when in the car with Martin's family, it is hard to feel anything because they have been two goofballs most of the time. Without spoiling anything, ending is a mixed bag for me because it is sad, but not a tearjerker like the movie wants it to be.The musical score by Dan Deacon makes no impression on me. It just sounds like generic music from any other movie. The needle drops are okay, but I wish they could find another song than Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. However, the credits song One Last Dance by Tom and Roman Morello and Grandson is really catchy and a great song to end the movie. Also, Maroon 5's Memories has a great needle drop here.Venom: The Last Dance is an entertaining movie. It is not well-made and not even as fun as the first film, but I overall had a pretty good time with the movie despite the many issues it has. I guess I cannot help but find Eddie and Venom a lot of fun to watch. Director Kelly Marcel did a great job with the scenes with those two and with the action scenes, but I think she bit off more than she could chew with the other subplots. If you like the Venom movies, you will probably enjoy this movie but if you never them then this movie will not change your mind.Stay through all of the credits.",Positive
651,"It is genuinely impressive that Sony managed to make the most mediocre trilogy ever with such an iconic character.In terms of enjoyment, Eddie and Venom continue to be a delightfully fun duo. In this 3rd movie, they are basically on a road trip and that was relatively entertaining for the most part. The final act of the movie was also a pretty enjoyable CGI action fest with some emotional scenes.However, the story and script are still as flat as ever. The narrative feels very half baked with it feeling like a chain of things just randomly happening. Pointless characters that don't add much. Jokes being thrown at you just to see which land. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor characters could have been played by anyone but feels purposely done because they knew fans recognised them from other Marvel projects. The villain Knull looks cool but is just there to be teased for future projects.Overall, it is better than the second film but just on par with the first. It is a mediocre final entry. Sony continues to disappoint with their universe and We all know Venom is coming back somehow. I do worry for Spiderman 4 and hope Sony don't mess that movie in anyway.",Neutral
652,"""Venom: The Last Dance' is a messy buddy road trip in which you must turn your brains off...again.Is it perfect? Nah, far from it. I think there are way too many storylines in here, and the main one got some potential, but it was wasted in typical Sony fashion. The ""Spider-Man 4"" rumors have been blown out of proportion in my opinion, so temper your expectations.The duo between Eddie and Venom is as fun as always. I mean Tom Hardy and the banter between them...I'm sorry, the banter between Hardy and himself is the best part of these movies (Hardy is doing the voice of Venom).The humor is there, but can't say I laughed all that much, beacause most of the jokes are base level childish again. It must be a bit more emotional as a whole, because supposedly is the last time we see Venom (hardly doubt), but it ends up kinda hollow.Knull is there...I guess, but will see how and when they'll use him again...it's Sony after all.It's a popcorn movie that reminds me of the early 2000's comic book movies. The action in the third act is good for the most parts and there are some funny moments here and there. Are there plot holes and some issues with the story? Yes. It's just another ""Turn your brains off"" Sony movie again.There are two credit scenes, first one is kinda important, the second one not so much.",Positive
653,"My relationship with the Venom franchise has been rocky. I have a soft spot for the first one, absolutely loathe the second, and now we come to the trilogy's closer, and thankfully, it's an improvement.Venom: The Last Dance works best when it focuses on Eddie and Venom's story instead of trying to set up the future of the Sonyverse. If you didn't like the previous Venom films, this won't change your mind. It's still messy, but it gets more right than its predecessors.This is easily the campiest and most mature of the bunch. It takes its time with the characters, letting us sit with them instead of rushing into the next action set piece. Still being PG-13 it manages to cram in a lot more gore than its predecessors. The action is inventive, and the humor hits its mark. It also doesn't shy away from getting personal and emotional. Eddie and Venom's relationship has never felt more genuine. I'll admit-I teared up a few times by the end.Some may be disappointed by the potrayal of Knull, but personally, I loved it. He feels like an overlooming threat rather than an one-off villain, and the ""God of Darkness"" gets a Thanos-esque treatment he deserves.Now, don't get me wrong-the movie is still bad, technically speaking-but it's self-aware about that. Instead of being ""bad bad,"" it chooses to be ""fun bad"" and entertain you, and I respect that. Not every movie needs to be great; sometimes being fun is enough.Even with the lows, I have always found a weird sense of comfort with this rendition of Venom. I have found myself caring more for these characters than maybe even the script intended. So I am happy to say that by the end, it does enough to justify this trilogy's existence - and to such an satisfying extent that I'd rather live in a world where the Venom movies exist than one where it doesn't.",Positive
654,"The third installment about the symbiotic anti-hero is a mix of bright moments and disappointments. Tom Hardy once again proves why he is the perfect choice for the role of Eddie Brock/Venom, but even his charismatic performance cannot save the unbalanced ensemble. The film starts off promisingly - with dynamic action and witty dialogue between Eddie and his symbiotic companion. Their relationship is still the best the series has to offer. Hardy brilliantly manages both comedic timing and dramatic moments. The visual effects are impressive in places, especially in the action sequences where Venom shows off his abilities. At other times, however, the CGI feels inadequate and more reminiscent of a video game from the last decade. Some fights are well choreographed, others are a chaotic mix of digital effects. The biggest problem is the script, which tries to be too ambitious. It mixes several storylines, introduces new characters and antagonists, but does not give them enough space to develop. The result is a rushed pace and superficial characters. The film's darker tone is a welcome change, but it often clashes with the comedic elements, creating an unbalanced whole. The film seems unsure whether it wants to be a serious drama or a lighthearted entertainment. Venom: The Last Dance is like a roller coaster - it's ups and downs. For fans of the series, it offers enough fun, but it's hard to call it a significant step forward. This film is like an average song on a great album, but as a whole it doesn't leave a strong impression. Fans will find their own, others may be disappointed.",Positive
655,"Maybe it's just because of my low expectations toward the series but it was just fun to watch. I've already lost hope for the trilogy to have a decent plot but I can say that this one has a better storyline than the second film.CGI was fine, I coudn't find any disturbing point. It was interesting to see the other symbiotes. I think those new symbiotes showed more symbiote-ish action scenes than venom when it comes to the fight ironically.There were a few funny jokes that made me laugh but I didn't really find Eddie's weird obsession for shoes funny, like was it supposed to be funny? Guess it was meant to be humor but well... it was almost tiring.",Neutral
656,"A solid enough send off for this 'Venom' trilogy.'Venom: The Last Dance' is decently amusing and produces enough entertainment with its plot. I didn't personally find it overly funny, though the person a few seats across from me had an absolute blast - never a bad thing seeing people enjoy themselves!Tom Hardy remains the key element of these films, they would be far less enjoyable without his presence. There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor stick out most from the other characters.",Negative

658,"Being Rated R probably would have saved this; I am just saying!This trilogy-capper almost makes me question if I have become more of a movie critic than a movie enjoyer. Then I remembered this is Sony's Spider-Man Universe we are talking about, which gave us films like ""Morbius"" and ""Madame Web."" I nonetheless went in here with an open mind, considering I do not mind the two previous ""Venom"" films that came out. After seeing ""The Last Dance,"" I question whether Sony was trying to set up their universe or give Eddie Brock and Venom the send-off they deserve. I am sadly leaning more toward the former.I should preface this review by telling you what I thought of the other two ""Venom"" films upon rewatch in preparation for this third installment. Those were entertaining yet disappointing superhero films saved by the performance of Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and Venom. The first was innocent enough, with a dull first and more engaging second half, a weak villain in Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake/Riot, exciting action, and Hardy performing nicely. Its sequel, ""Let There Be Carnage,"" surprisingly got better when revisiting it, easily surpassing its predecessor, with Hardy allowed to stretch his comedic abilities with Brock and Venom bickering hilariously. In addition, there is Woody Harrelson's enjoyable performance as Cletus Kasady/Carnage, who manages to rise above the flaws, including the disappointing inclusion of Naomie Harris' Frances Barrison/Shriek. Hardy was allowed to have fun with his characters, and the movies complimented him with a narrative that was not too complicated. The opposite is true for ""The Last Dance.""Let's get the positives out of the way first. It is a short list, which I am deeply saddened by, but I want to show you how it is not the worst superhero film out there or even the worst film of the year.Despite a woeful screenplay, Tom Hardy still does skillfully with Eddie Brock and Venom. He is not allowed to have as much fun as he did in the prior two films, but he is trying his best (right, the positives. Sorry).The rest of the cast delivered equally solid performances, with the other standout being Chiwetel Ejiofor as Orwell Taylor. Ejiofor always has a commanding presence whenever he is in a movie, with his characters of Baron Mordo in the two ""Doctor Strange"" films and Bathurst 2020 in the forgettable ""Infinite"" being the two I can think of at the top of my head. Even if the film is not the best, Ejiofor makes it work, and if it is fantastic, he always steals the show.The visual effects bring Venom and the other alien characters to gorgeous life. The other two ""Venom"" movies, granted, had remarkable CGI, but it is worth mentioning, specifically when discussing the positives.The action is somewhat fun. The ""Venom"" movies have always had enjoyable action. Unfortunately, ""The Last Dance"" was the least fun action-wise, but the first scene with action was sweet.The Venom symbiote is sometimes uniquely utilized. The trailers showcased Venom controlling a horse, and in the film, it is one of its best scenes. I am unsure if this is a spoiler, but he controls other animals, and they introduce other symbiotes, which is fun.I think that is it for the positives.I felt the portrayal of Eddie Brock and Venom this time was not good. Again, Hardy tried, but there were multiple times when it felt like he was bored. His character was, admittedly, bored at intervals, and Hardy is a screenwriter, but I am saying how it felt.The film tries to add new characters, but they are not compelling. The most obvious example is Dr. Payne, played by Juno Temple, who does nothing aside from believing that Brock is not a danger, while Ejiofor wants what is best for the world, considering the alien threat from Knull.Speaking of Knull, he was worse than Carlton Drake. He only sends alien minions to grab a MacGuffin that Venom has. I have not read the comics, but the impression I get from others and this movie is that Knull has a profound lore not represented here. Having Knull's alien pals and the Area 51 agents as the villains is too much, yet somehow too little.They also wasted Stephen Graham's Detective Mulligan. The trailers made it seem like Mulligan would be a principal and intriguing character. The only two interesting aspects about Mulligan are he has a symbiote and warns of Knull. That is it.Furthermore, it does not have that much comedy. ""Let There Be Carnage"" can easily be classified as a comedy, and I laughed more than I would like to admit. I think two laughs and three to five chuckles were all I had here. The film was not funny outside of the Venom horse and some banter between Brock and Venom.On top of that, there was not that much emotion. It is due to how much Brock and Venom were not well utilized and the clutter of characters. I did not care about the Area 51 personnel nor the unnamed family who brought Brock and Venom to Vegas. When the ending came along, which heightened the stakes to an unbelievable degree, I did not get emotional. It tried, but it failed to work.The other two ""Venom"" movies were entertaining, but this failed to come close. In an era where ""superhero fatigue"" is becoming more accepted, this trilogy-closer did not try anything new. Fascinating concepts here and there, and many standout scenes fail to save this disappointment in a franchise filled with them.Technically, a 6/10. Outside of the plot and the underwhelming screenplay, the visual effects remain exceptional, the actors did great, and the film functions.For the enjoyment score, I wanted to like this film. I had the sneaking suspicion that it might not work, but watching ""Let There Be Carnage"" increase in quality gave me hope. It was no ""Let There Be Carnage"" and is easily the weakest of the trilogy. It had the issues that plagued the likes of ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but does not come close to being as entertaining as them. I am so unhappy that the enjoyment score is a 4/10, but this trilogy deserved a better conclusion. Maybe it will get better when I watch it again, but as it stands, it is best for me to recommend you wait until Netflix or even Disney+.",Positive
659,"This movie was very middle of the road to me. Definitely better than the second one, but not as good as the original.I enjoyed the beginning very much. Nice pace, good story and funny at times. Also the last part was packed with action and it all looked amazing. Only thing I missed was some sort of a climax at the very end.The middle however, I did not care for too much. Some things felt forced, rushed and very unlikely. But as I often say in my reviews: 'It is a fictional, fantasy, action movie so who cares if some things do not add up.'As a whole I enjoyed it very much, Tom Hardy did not disappoint.",Positive
660,"I just don't get it, I thought the 1st Venom was good despite many fans may not have liked it. I'm not a comic fan, so for me it was good that they try to make it as relatable and realistic to just your average movie goer.The 2nd film was cringy and terrible in my opinion because the story didn't make much sense, too much drama, poetry, and bromance. I lost interest after watching that one but the trailer for this film looked good.Right from the beginning I realize this was going to be bad. I don't care about the multi-verse, I don't care about Knull, I don't care about all these comic lores. The story is completely unrelatable and the suspension of disbelief failed early on.And then to top it off, the ending was just awful.4/10 for the special effects. Everything else is a 0.",Negative
661,"If you've already come to terms with this version of Venom and Eddie Brock as more of a bromance than the savage, brutal duo from the comics, you're in for a fun ride, Venom: The Last Dance, the final chapter of the trilogy, delivers an entertaining ride with solid pacing, good performances, decent visual effects, and fun engaging enough story, added also with the joy of let all the madness fan service out makes Venom: The Last Dance an easy good time especially for me, even the serious part mostly with Chiwetel Ejiofor was executed pretty well, surprising wholesome moments with Rhys Ifans and his family characters, flawed? Sure, some of the editing cuts didn't quite work for me, there were a few cheesy, awkward moments that felt off, and nit picky here and there, overall, i have a good time with Venom: The Last Dance, and the most surprising thing also the least thing i could expect watching this supposed to be last time we'll see both Venom and Eddie was that i did get quite emotional at the end, it's clear they've evolved from mere host and symbiote to something much deeper, and their dynamic was surprisingly touching, my personal experience with these two also comes as long as these three movies together, and as the movie itself whether it's better than the first one which also a good movie in my opinion, The Last Dance succeeded my expectation from being far from bad, i want this goodbye to be at least watchable enough, and the result is more than that, Venom: The Last Dance is actually a good film, just like Venom would say, We are Venom, and this film makes sure we feel it.",Negative
662,"Fun, wild, and hot mess. There's too much plot that's never explained. Events just happen randomly with no payoff, with a big action scene towards the end. Eddie & Venom Bromance is the savior of this trilogy. If you enjoy the others you will enjoy this.Synopsis:
In Venom: The Last Dance, Tom Hardy returns as Venom, one of Marvel's greatest and most complex characters, for the final film in the trilogy. Eddie and Venom are on the run. Hunted by both of their worlds and with the net closing in, the duo are forced into a devastating decision that will bring the curtains down on Venom and Eddie's last dance.",Positive
663,"If you were hoping for a grand finale to the Venom franchise that would surpass the comedic heights of its predecessors, you're in for a letdown. While Venom: The Last Dance does deliver on the comedic front, it falls short in nearly every other aspect.The film picks up right where we left off, with Eddie Brock and Venom still on the run. The plot takes a convoluted turn as they become embroiled in a government conspiracy involving symbiotes and a dangerous threat to the universe. While the premise is intriguing, the execution feels rushed and often confusing.The real draw of this film, as with its predecessors, is the chemistry between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom. Their banter and witty exchanges provide much-needed humor and keep the film entertaining. However, the comedic elements can feel forced at times, and the overall tone can be uneven.The film's biggest flaw is its reliance on poor CGI and even worse dialogue. The visual effects, particularly those involving the titular symbiote, often feel like a step back from previous entries. Venom's appearances are fleeting, and when he does appear in full form, he's often overshadowed by lackluster animation.The script is equally disappointing. The story lacks depth and originality, and the characters feel one-dimensional. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the pacing feels uneven. While there are a few moments of humor that might elicit a chuckle, they're not enough to salvage the film.Ultimately, Venom: The Last Dance is a missed opportunity. It's a shame that such a potentially fun franchise has ended on such a sour note.",Negative
664,"If cinematic catastrophes could have a mascot, this would be standing at the front of the line, waving its tattered flag of mediocrity. Tom Hardy's final outing as Eddie Brock/Venom is not just a disappointment-it's an insult to audiences everywhere. To call this movie bad would be a kindness. This is an incoherent, muddled, and utterly joyless mess that somehow manages to fall short of even the lowest expectations.The premise of Eddie and Venom being ""on the run"" from both worlds promised at least some thrilling action. Instead, what we get is a chaotic, poorly-scripted nightmare of disjointed scenes and absurd plot holes big enough to swallow the entire Marvel universe. The narrative, if you can call it that, lurches forward with all the grace of a drunken man stumbling in the dark. There is no rhyme or reason to the events that unfold. It's like the writers cobbled together every half-baked idea they could think of and hoped nobody would notice how little sense any of it makes.The so-called ""devastating decision"" that Eddie and Venom face feels less like a culmination of their journey and more like a cheap, hollow ploy to yank on the audience's emotions. But even that attempt falls flat because, by the time it arrives, the viewer is too exhausted from enduring 90 minutes of mindless drivel to care.Eddie Brock, once a complex and conflicted anti-hero from the source comics, is reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self, mumbling and stumbling through the film like he just wants to get it over with.The supporting characters are even worse-if that's possible. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use cardboard cutouts of side characters nobody cares about and clearly has no understanding of what made the earlier films (barely) work.They serve no purpose other than to waste screen time and remind us that, yes, someone actually wrote this drivel down on paper.It wouldn't be a Venom movie without over-the-top CGI battles, right? Well, unfortunately, the action scenes here are so poorly executed and short to save cost that even those who came purely for mindless entertainment will leave disappointed. The special effects are a headache-inducing blur of dark, indistinguishable shapes smashing into each other, with zero sense of tension or creativity.The final fight scene feels like -an unintelligible swirl of chaos that is supposed to distract us from the fact that nothing of consequence is happening. It's not exciting, it's not entertaining, it's just ugly.At its core it tries to sell itself as a dramatic, emotional farewell to Eddie and Venom's bond, but it doesn't even come close to achieving that. Any attempt at emotional weight is drowned by the film's clumsy pacing and complete lack of character development. The so-called ""devastating"" decision feels unearned, forced, and utterly unconvincing. There is no sense of closure, no satisfying payoff-just a hollow, empty finale that leaves you wondering why you wasted your time in the first place.Avoid this movie like the symbiote plague it is. Eddie and Venom deserved better. We all deserved better.Tom's ego and nepotism to promote his FWB director both of whom had sole credit of writing the script should tell you that how much he actually despises the franchise.Tom was the ultimate culprit is giving the first movie it's comic tone and had heated arguments with Ruben Flesicher on set to such an extent that filming halted for a few days. There were 3 script writers on the first movie can you guess who was one of them?It's the director of this movie who with her relationship strong armed and hijacked the plot elements and forced to introduce the comic tone into the first movie by reshooting the movie which had resulted in a disjointed mess.Even the Ruben had expressed his deep regrets about that but I guess if you can control the leading star you can have your way.If you closely look at the tone of the first movie first trailer you will notice the horror and science fiction elements present which had been stripped down to barebones and gag and quips reigned supreme.",Negative
665,"My wife and I watched Venom: The Last Dance (2024) last night in theaters. The storyline follows Eddie Brock, who is on the run from the law and hiding in Mexico. When an invasion from Venom's home world begins, Eddie must make his way to Area 51 to find reinforcements and fight off the invaders.Directed by Kelly Marcel in her directorial debut, the film stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Rhys Ifans (The Amazing Spider-Man), Stephen Graham (Snatch), and Juno Temple (Killer Joe).I absolutely loved the first two-thirds of this film. Tom Hardy nailed his role, bringing a perfect blend of humor, action, and Venom's signature appetite for chaos. The various forms Venom takes are visually entertaining, and the self-deprecating humor is spot-on. We especially enjoyed the introduction of a quirky ""hippie family,"" who added a fun twist. However, once the story shifts to Area 51, things feel rushed and forced. The other symbiotes look incredible, but they come and go so quickly that you're left wanting more. The villain's defeat also felt underwhelming, and I wanted a bit more depth in their storyline. The homage at the end felt somewhat awkward as well.In conclusion, Venom: The Last Dance is a fun watch and definitely worth seeing for fans of the character, though it doesn't quite reach its full potential. I'd rate it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Positive

667,"Venom 3 is fun movie. It will never be critically rated, but it doesn't need or try to be. It is fun, it is weird, it looks good and the interactions between Eddie and Venom are great as always and are funny unlike the forced jokes that don't always land. We get to see a bit more of the rest of the symbiotes, but it is not a major focus of the movie to introduce or highlight them, which was a bit disappointing personally. The storyline is a bit messy, and there are a few plotholes and illogical, unexplainable events, but the movie does a good job of actually taking the viewers through it. We get and ending to the trilogy that is pretty much what you expect, but the emotional charge of it feels a bit forced and doesn't let the viewer appreciate it for themselves. We also get a glimpse of what may come in the future, including a namedrop that comic fans will get, so we may see more of our goofy antihero in the future.",Positive
668,"Venom The Last Dance was hilarious, emotional and entertaining. Went in with the same expectations as before very low. I'm shocked about the critics, cause they expected much more unreal scenarios. Here again Sony is not stupid of course they'd have added a specific character in their world, but they probably can't because of a certain contract clause. The third movie is much better than the second cause the second movie suffered from extreme cuts which took out all its potential. Despite the fact that Venom was rumored and in productions ever since early 00s it's no wonder they made a trilogy and had box office success, cause Tom Hardy carried those movies on his own. Every other actor wouldn't be able to pull out this great chemistry between him and Venom. I'm not biased I see its flaws and weaknesses, but my God some critics thrashed this movie as if it's another Morbius or Madame Web. It's by far a better movie.The road trip family was adorable not necessary but there to add a more family atmosphere and emotional touch to this film. Juno Temple was good but underperformed and here background story was dragged into this movie.Ms Cheng was probably the best positive highlight of the movie besides the love for dogs and animals in general.A lot of great symbionts and designs were actually great to watch. I can't say much more to that point cause I want to avoid spoilers.The issuesThe plot and goal of the movie is clear but gets lost through the movie. The action sequences and CGI were average at best. I know that sounds awful for a higher rating, but hear me out. The cast was decent and some actors really shined here.Another problem is the camera work here too many fast cuts hardly to see specially when I think I was obligated to watch it in 3D. I prefer 2D.The biggest problem was there is no clear 1 v 1 villain here with heart and intentions. We have Knull as the big bad in the background but barely seen but only to bait us fans to watch it and another mystery character from the army or swat like crew not shown at all. Where as the first two movies had clear antagonists shown.Issue / or averageThe Ending was emotional and impactful with rushed bangs, but man there were some scenes I really felt touched by it. I still think they could've done more and Tom deserved more !I give it 6 but as a trilogy part and the Tom Hardy factor a light 7, cause reviews between 1-4 stars are harsh. And yeah don't leave there are two important post credit scenes. I'm really looking forward !",Positive

670,"Barely emotional. Barely funny. Barely mediocre. From this pattern, it can be deducted that Venom: The Last Dance is a passable movie that doesn't do enough right to feel like an epic send off, or do anything inherently wrong to be worth complaining about. It's just fine.Tom Hardy is once again the easy stand-out as Eddie Brock, using the same janky physical actions as Venom manipulates his movements to an entertaining degree. The humour is the same safe but fine lines of dialogue that either evoke a chuckle or short exhale of breath. The action scenes escalate in levels of excitement throughout the film, with the final act especially delivering some really fun mayhem. And being the supposed final film of the trilogy, there are some surprisingly tender moments sprinkled in, but aren't frequent enough to draw any real emotion.As aforementioned, the humour is fine but there's one particular segment of the film in Las Vegas that feels too ridiculous and reckless in the context of the movie. Moreover, the story sets up rules that either get contradicted, forgotten, or straight up ignored for the sake of 'cool' scenes. Aside from Eddie and Venom, the rest of the cast of characters come off as either underutilised, underdeveloped, or unnecessary. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rhys Ifans feel criminally wasted, Juno Temple and Clark Backo undermine each other as their characters could've been just compiled into one due to their similar traits, and Stephen Graham and Peggy Lu don't do much to feel properly utilised, especially Graham, who's character felt like was building up to a bigger pay-off than what we got. And the antagonist Knull was so sidelined that there's not much more to say about him other than 'he was in the movie'.In conclusion, for what Venom: The Last Dance can't deliver in a concise plot or compelling side characters, it manages to make up for it with fun symbiote action and mostly entertaining and semi-heartfelt sequences.",Negative
671,"Sony should publicly apologise to the audience for making this worst movie and make the audience suffer and wasted their time. So boring story, nothing to appreciate only actor (Tom Hardy) has done, good acting Else, everyone, not done anything to discuss, that's why am giving one star.Don't waste your money by going into the theatres. CGI was good, but story was so pathetic. You can just guess the whole picture by trailer waste of money. Tom Hardy should try superhero movies with other Studios sony is not good with superheroes. We have already seen this with Superman. Middle part was so boring and ending was too predictable.",Negative
672,"Venom: The Last Dance delivers exactly what it promises-an absurdly fun, high-octane ride with a surprising amount of heart. If you expected Avengers: Endgame level of finality, you walked into the wrong theater, but for those who wanted a dumb but entertaining alien-human bromance, this one's for you.This film is easily the best in the trilogy, blending sharp pacing, humor that actually lands, and action sequences that never feel forced. The weird yet charming dynamic between Eddie and Venom is in full swing, and the filmmakers know exactly how to tap into the ridiculous yet endearing relationship that has become the backbone of this series. It's self-aware without feeling desperate for laughs, striking a balance that's tough to nail in superhero movies these days.While some of the gore pushes the limits of PG-13, it's never gratuitous. There's enough bite to the violence to keep you hooked, but it stops short of being overwhelming. If anything, it adds a little edge to an otherwise slick, polished blockbuster.But the real kicker here is that, amidst all the chaos, Venom: The Last Dance sneaks in some genuine emotion. It's a film about keeping your best bro close, and somehow that works. So why all the hate? It's a popcorn flick that knows exactly what it is, and honestly, that's rare these days.",Positive
673,Almost the whole cast was full. The only cast members that helped was the family and of course the store lady. Mulligan was boring . I felt there was a power struggle when writing this. One wanted to show ase strong women yet made them look stupied and to emotional; while the other smart men but utterly useless in the long run causing more havoc and not thinking before moving.The CGI are as ok. The one creatures could have been way way more creative for sure.Over all it's a lack luster film unfortunately 😕..there's so much they could have done with Tom and this story line. We needed a version of him and Spider man yet have been robbed of that.,Negative
674,"First and foremost, it felt like the makers made every poor decision possible when it came to the sound tracks and music. That which is supposed to amplify the intensity of ride simply let it remain bland throughout, even the climax, even the falling action.With Venom and Eddie having largely ceased their bickering, their bromance has dwindled significantly in this movie. Being the conclusional piece of this hilarious trilogy, it has fallen short of many expectations.Of course there was some of those promised action as witnessed in the trailers. But was there something which swept me off my feet which was absent from the trailers? Not really.While the villain's back-story is rather solid, it could have been more centre-stage. Most of the characters that have made appearance in this movie felt weakly woven together; though the plot could not have moved forward without their roles, they barely left any impact. Speaking of the plot, it largely remains uneventful, with the makers just throwing a few name-sake 3D effect villainous creatures at our faces. There is only one major action sequence throughout the film, that it low-key has bottled down to something I would either skim through, or watch at a slightly increased playback speed.If the unnecessary scenes, and by that I mean, 'adding no humor or value to the plot' scenes were deleted, it could easily boil down to half its current run-time. That being said, there could definitely be leads from where this movie has left loose ends at, but presently, it stays far aloof from being involved in such a gifting.I feel like the last of the trilogy has not done justice to the previous two movies, it almost feels like watching a different character. The ending in particular came off to me as a tryhard terrific ending, and even if the clips were good, the track choices really did not work out for me.",Negative
675,"Eddie and Venom are on the run as fugitives after their battle with Carnage. They are chased by military force and aliens that want to capture them for their codex to unleash a greater evil in their world. Eddie and Venom venture out for a while avoiding authorities and the alien species.I am a fan of the first Venom movie. It is not a well-made movie, but it is so entertaining because of Tom Hardy's crazy performance in both roles and the wacky humor throughout the film. The second movie is much better made mainly because of Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris, but I actually enjoyed the first one more on a fun level. I was pretty excited for the third film and the trailers had me hooked. Does this trilogy end on a memorable last dance?I have mixed thoughts on Venom: The Last Dance. Let's start with the good. I love Eddie and Venom's dynamic and they are at their best in this movie. They have fun chemistry and banter and it feels like they are finally starting to get along with each other a bit better. They also have a few emotional moments that can come off as cheesy, but they have charm especially one scene where Eddie reassures Martin's son that his alien friend is there to help and Venom thanks the kid for a piece of chocolate. In a movie filled with silly moments and action-packed battles, it is a really sweet moment that shows how heroic Eddie and Venom have become.It helps that Tom Hardy is an absolute joy to watch. Hardy relishes in both of his roles and he never lets up. There are several moments of him doing stuff like going crazy at the slot machine and creating a drink at the bar by himself in a quick way. He also handles the more dramatic scenes very well making the more emotional moments work better than they should have.Also, Venom is a very cool character here. He is funny, his powers are awesome and he does anything to protect Eddie even knowing that if they are both alive the aliens will track them down because they have a codex. Venom's antics are very endearing and it seems like he just wants to join the fun and even tries to get Eddie to join in. I love watching him take control of other animals such as a horse, a fish and a frog. Venom is so much fun to watch and he is a good reason why I enjoy these movies despite their faults.The humor is for the most part pretty good. There is one gag that I cringed at but other than that, I got several laughs out of this movie. The banter between Eddie and Venom never gets old for me.The action scenes are pretty entertaining. The chase scene in the river is a standout because it looks cool, it has Eddie Brock defend himself without Venom and Venom turning into other creatures. It is also frenetic and fun to see play out. The climax is also big full of cool moments, but it is a little CGI heavy. However, it features Venom on a motorcycle again and it looks great. Overall, I enjoyed the action.The cinematography by Fabian Wagner is solid and colorful. The lighting is also on point with all of the scenes being lit well enough to see while having some flare in the shots. This is by far the best looking Venom movie filmmaking wise. The special effects are more polished and the alien creatures chasing Venom and Eddie look very menacing. Honestly, they kind of remind me of the Kaijus from Pacific Rim and I like that. There also other symbiotes in the film and they look very cool with their designs, but some of their colors blend in. The visuals are not perfect, but they are an upgrade from the last two movies.All that said, there are a few problems I have with this movie. The biggest problem is that the script is overstuffed. I know that there needs to other plot lines to have the story come together, but some of them do not work at all. The scientists subplot is one of the most boring parts of the movie with how slowly paced it is and how the tone shifts from fun to dreary and not the good kind of dreary. The subplot with Martin and his family is okay and has some great moments, but it can drag a little too long.The supporting cast does not hold a candle to Tom Hardy. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Rex Strickland is the best supporting performance, but his character is too unlikable to root for. Dr. Payne is kind of there until the climax. Clark Backo as Sadie Christmas is alright and she does a lot in the climax, but her character does not stand out until then. Rhys Ifans is having a lot of fun in his role as a family man who believes in aliens. While his family may have gotten a little more focus than they should have, Ifans is pretty fun to watch at times. Andy Serkis as Knull is absolutely wasted. He seems like a menacing villain, but he gets little to do aside from getting expository dialogue. By far, the weakest link in the film and wastes Andy Serkis on a limited role.The tone is all over the place. There are moments where this movie acts like a cheesy road trip comedy with Eddie and Venom and then the next scene could be overly serious research about the symbiotes. The movie progressively darker as it goes along and it has some moments that should come off as emotional and while they kind of work because of Tom Hardy's performance and the duo's likability, they feel a bit unearned because of how comedic this series is by now. When Eddie and Venom ponder the life they could have had when in the car with Martin's family, it is hard to feel anything because they have been two goofballs most of the time. Without spoiling anything, ending is a mixed bag for me because it is sad, but not a tearjerker like the movie wants it to be.The musical score by Dan Deacon makes no impression on me. It just sounds like generic music from any other movie. The needle drops are okay, but I wish they could find another song than Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. However, the credits song One Last Dance by Tom and Roman Morello and Grandson is really catchy and a great song to end the movie. Also, Maroon 5's Memories has a great needle drop here.Venom: The Last Dance is an entertaining movie. It is not well-made and not even as fun as the first film, but I overall had a pretty good time with the movie despite the many issues it has. I guess I cannot help but find Eddie and Venom a lot of fun to watch. Director Kelly Marcel did a great job with the scenes with those two and with the action scenes, but I think she bit off more than she could chew with the other subplots. If you like the Venom movies, you will probably enjoy this movie but if you never them then this movie will not change your mind.Stay through all of the credits.",Positive
676,"It is genuinely impressive that Sony managed to make the most mediocre trilogy ever with such an iconic character.In terms of enjoyment, Eddie and Venom continue to be a delightfully fun duo. In this 3rd movie, they are basically on a road trip and that was relatively entertaining for the most part. The final act of the movie was also a pretty enjoyable CGI action fest with some emotional scenes.However, the story and script are still as flat as ever. The narrative feels very half baked with it feeling like a chain of things just randomly happening. Pointless characters that don't add much. Jokes being thrown at you just to see which land. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor characters could have been played by anyone but feels purposely done because they knew fans recognised them from other Marvel projects. The villain Knull looks cool but is just there to be teased for future projects.Overall, it is better than the second film but just on par with the first. It is a mediocre final entry. Sony continues to disappoint with their universe and We all know Venom is coming back somehow. I do worry for Spiderman 4 and hope Sony don't mess that movie in anyway.",Neutral
677,"""Venom: The Last Dance' is a messy buddy road trip in which you must turn your brains off...again.Is it perfect? Nah, far from it. I think there are way too many storylines in here, and the main one got some potential, but it was wasted in typical Sony fashion. The ""Spider-Man 4"" rumors have been blown out of proportion in my opinion, so temper your expectations.The duo between Eddie and Venom is as fun as always. I mean Tom Hardy and the banter between them...I'm sorry, the banter between Hardy and himself is the best part of these movies (Hardy is doing the voice of Venom).The humor is there, but can't say I laughed all that much, beacause most of the jokes are base level childish again. It must be a bit more emotional as a whole, because supposedly is the last time we see Venom (hardly doubt), but it ends up kinda hollow.Knull is there...I guess, but will see how and when they'll use him again...it's Sony after all.It's a popcorn movie that reminds me of the early 2000's comic book movies. The action in the third act is good for the most parts and there are some funny moments here and there. Are there plot holes and some issues with the story? Yes. It's just another ""Turn your brains off"" Sony movie again.There are two credit scenes, first one is kinda important, the second one not so much.",Positive
678,"My relationship with the Venom franchise has been rocky. I have a soft spot for the first one, absolutely loathe the second, and now we come to the trilogy's closer, and thankfully, it's an improvement.Venom: The Last Dance works best when it focuses on Eddie and Venom's story instead of trying to set up the future of the Sonyverse. If you didn't like the previous Venom films, this won't change your mind. It's still messy, but it gets more right than its predecessors.This is easily the campiest and most mature of the bunch. It takes its time with the characters, letting us sit with them instead of rushing into the next action set piece. Still being PG-13 it manages to cram in a lot more gore than its predecessors. The action is inventive, and the humor hits its mark. It also doesn't shy away from getting personal and emotional. Eddie and Venom's relationship has never felt more genuine. I'll admit-I teared up a few times by the end.Some may be disappointed by the potrayal of Knull, but personally, I loved it. He feels like an overlooming threat rather than an one-off villain, and the ""God of Darkness"" gets a Thanos-esque treatment he deserves.Now, don't get me wrong-the movie is still bad, technically speaking-but it's self-aware about that. Instead of being ""bad bad,"" it chooses to be ""fun bad"" and entertain you, and I respect that. Not every movie needs to be great; sometimes being fun is enough.Even with the lows, I have always found a weird sense of comfort with this rendition of Venom. I have found myself caring more for these characters than maybe even the script intended. So I am happy to say that by the end, it does enough to justify this trilogy's existence - and to such an satisfying extent that I'd rather live in a world where the Venom movies exist than one where it doesn't.",Positive
679,"The third installment about the symbiotic anti-hero is a mix of bright moments and disappointments. Tom Hardy once again proves why he is the perfect choice for the role of Eddie Brock/Venom, but even his charismatic performance cannot save the unbalanced ensemble. The film starts off promisingly - with dynamic action and witty dialogue between Eddie and his symbiotic companion. Their relationship is still the best the series has to offer. Hardy brilliantly manages both comedic timing and dramatic moments. The visual effects are impressive in places, especially in the action sequences where Venom shows off his abilities. At other times, however, the CGI feels inadequate and more reminiscent of a video game from the last decade. Some fights are well choreographed, others are a chaotic mix of digital effects. The biggest problem is the script, which tries to be too ambitious. It mixes several storylines, introduces new characters and antagonists, but does not give them enough space to develop. The result is a rushed pace and superficial characters. The film's darker tone is a welcome change, but it often clashes with the comedic elements, creating an unbalanced whole. The film seems unsure whether it wants to be a serious drama or a lighthearted entertainment. Venom: The Last Dance is like a roller coaster - it's ups and downs. For fans of the series, it offers enough fun, but it's hard to call it a significant step forward. This film is like an average song on a great album, but as a whole it doesn't leave a strong impression. Fans will find their own, others may be disappointed.",Positive
680,"Maybe it's just because of my low expectations toward the series but it was just fun to watch. I've already lost hope for the trilogy to have a decent plot but I can say that this one has a better storyline than the second film.CGI was fine, I coudn't find any disturbing point. It was interesting to see the other symbiotes. I think those new symbiotes showed more symbiote-ish action scenes than venom when it comes to the fight ironically.There were a few funny jokes that made me laugh but I didn't really find Eddie's weird obsession for shoes funny, like was it supposed to be funny? Guess it was meant to be humor but well... it was almost tiring.",Neutral
681,"A solid enough send off for this 'Venom' trilogy.'Venom: The Last Dance' is decently amusing and produces enough entertainment with its plot. I didn't personally find it overly funny, though the person a few seats across from me had an absolute blast - never a bad thing seeing people enjoy themselves!Tom Hardy remains the key element of these films, they would be far less enjoyable without his presence. There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor stick out most from the other characters.",Negative

683,"Being Rated R probably would have saved this; I am just saying!This trilogy-capper almost makes me question if I have become more of a movie critic than a movie enjoyer. Then I remembered this is Sony's Spider-Man Universe we are talking about, which gave us films like ""Morbius"" and ""Madame Web."" I nonetheless went in here with an open mind, considering I do not mind the two previous ""Venom"" films that came out. After seeing ""The Last Dance,"" I question whether Sony was trying to set up their universe or give Eddie Brock and Venom the send-off they deserve. I am sadly leaning more toward the former.I should preface this review by telling you what I thought of the other two ""Venom"" films upon rewatch in preparation for this third installment. Those were entertaining yet disappointing superhero films saved by the performance of Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and Venom. The first was innocent enough, with a dull first and more engaging second half, a weak villain in Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake/Riot, exciting action, and Hardy performing nicely. Its sequel, ""Let There Be Carnage,"" surprisingly got better when revisiting it, easily surpassing its predecessor, with Hardy allowed to stretch his comedic abilities with Brock and Venom bickering hilariously. In addition, there is Woody Harrelson's enjoyable performance as Cletus Kasady/Carnage, who manages to rise above the flaws, including the disappointing inclusion of Naomie Harris' Frances Barrison/Shriek. Hardy was allowed to have fun with his characters, and the movies complimented him with a narrative that was not too complicated. The opposite is true for ""The Last Dance.""Let's get the positives out of the way first. It is a short list, which I am deeply saddened by, but I want to show you how it is not the worst superhero film out there or even the worst film of the year.Despite a woeful screenplay, Tom Hardy still does skillfully with Eddie Brock and Venom. He is not allowed to have as much fun as he did in the prior two films, but he is trying his best (right, the positives. Sorry).The rest of the cast delivered equally solid performances, with the other standout being Chiwetel Ejiofor as Orwell Taylor. Ejiofor always has a commanding presence whenever he is in a movie, with his characters of Baron Mordo in the two ""Doctor Strange"" films and Bathurst 2020 in the forgettable ""Infinite"" being the two I can think of at the top of my head. Even if the film is not the best, Ejiofor makes it work, and if it is fantastic, he always steals the show.The visual effects bring Venom and the other alien characters to gorgeous life. The other two ""Venom"" movies, granted, had remarkable CGI, but it is worth mentioning, specifically when discussing the positives.The action is somewhat fun. The ""Venom"" movies have always had enjoyable action. Unfortunately, ""The Last Dance"" was the least fun action-wise, but the first scene with action was sweet.The Venom symbiote is sometimes uniquely utilized. The trailers showcased Venom controlling a horse, and in the film, it is one of its best scenes. I am unsure if this is a spoiler, but he controls other animals, and they introduce other symbiotes, which is fun.I think that is it for the positives.I felt the portrayal of Eddie Brock and Venom this time was not good. Again, Hardy tried, but there were multiple times when it felt like he was bored. His character was, admittedly, bored at intervals, and Hardy is a screenwriter, but I am saying how it felt.The film tries to add new characters, but they are not compelling. The most obvious example is Dr. Payne, played by Juno Temple, who does nothing aside from believing that Brock is not a danger, while Ejiofor wants what is best for the world, considering the alien threat from Knull.Speaking of Knull, he was worse than Carlton Drake. He only sends alien minions to grab a MacGuffin that Venom has. I have not read the comics, but the impression I get from others and this movie is that Knull has a profound lore not represented here. Having Knull's alien pals and the Area 51 agents as the villains is too much, yet somehow too little.They also wasted Stephen Graham's Detective Mulligan. The trailers made it seem like Mulligan would be a principal and intriguing character. The only two interesting aspects about Mulligan are he has a symbiote and warns of Knull. That is it.Furthermore, it does not have that much comedy. ""Let There Be Carnage"" can easily be classified as a comedy, and I laughed more than I would like to admit. I think two laughs and three to five chuckles were all I had here. The film was not funny outside of the Venom horse and some banter between Brock and Venom.On top of that, there was not that much emotion. It is due to how much Brock and Venom were not well utilized and the clutter of characters. I did not care about the Area 51 personnel nor the unnamed family who brought Brock and Venom to Vegas. When the ending came along, which heightened the stakes to an unbelievable degree, I did not get emotional. It tried, but it failed to work.The other two ""Venom"" movies were entertaining, but this failed to come close. In an era where ""superhero fatigue"" is becoming more accepted, this trilogy-closer did not try anything new. Fascinating concepts here and there, and many standout scenes fail to save this disappointment in a franchise filled with them.Technically, a 6/10. Outside of the plot and the underwhelming screenplay, the visual effects remain exceptional, the actors did great, and the film functions.For the enjoyment score, I wanted to like this film. I had the sneaking suspicion that it might not work, but watching ""Let There Be Carnage"" increase in quality gave me hope. It was no ""Let There Be Carnage"" and is easily the weakest of the trilogy. It had the issues that plagued the likes of ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but does not come close to being as entertaining as them. I am so unhappy that the enjoyment score is a 4/10, but this trilogy deserved a better conclusion. Maybe it will get better when I watch it again, but as it stands, it is best for me to recommend you wait until Netflix or even Disney+.",Positive
684,"This movie was very middle of the road to me. Definitely better than the second one, but not as good as the original.I enjoyed the beginning very much. Nice pace, good story and funny at times. Also the last part was packed with action and it all looked amazing. Only thing I missed was some sort of a climax at the very end.The middle however, I did not care for too much. Some things felt forced, rushed and very unlikely. But as I often say in my reviews: 'It is a fictional, fantasy, action movie so who cares if some things do not add up.'As a whole I enjoyed it very much, Tom Hardy did not disappoint.",Positive
685,"I just don't get it, I thought the 1st Venom was good despite many fans may not have liked it. I'm not a comic fan, so for me it was good that they try to make it as relatable and realistic to just your average movie goer.The 2nd film was cringy and terrible in my opinion because the story didn't make much sense, too much drama, poetry, and bromance. I lost interest after watching that one but the trailer for this film looked good.Right from the beginning I realize this was going to be bad. I don't care about the multi-verse, I don't care about Knull, I don't care about all these comic lores. The story is completely unrelatable and the suspension of disbelief failed early on.And then to top it off, the ending was just awful.4/10 for the special effects. Everything else is a 0.",Negative
686,"If you've already come to terms with this version of Venom and Eddie Brock as more of a bromance than the savage, brutal duo from the comics, you're in for a fun ride, Venom: The Last Dance, the final chapter of the trilogy, delivers an entertaining ride with solid pacing, good performances, decent visual effects, and fun engaging enough story, added also with the joy of let all the madness fan service out makes Venom: The Last Dance an easy good time especially for me, even the serious part mostly with Chiwetel Ejiofor was executed pretty well, surprising wholesome moments with Rhys Ifans and his family characters, flawed? Sure, some of the editing cuts didn't quite work for me, there were a few cheesy, awkward moments that felt off, and nit picky here and there, overall, i have a good time with Venom: The Last Dance, and the most surprising thing also the least thing i could expect watching this supposed to be last time we'll see both Venom and Eddie was that i did get quite emotional at the end, it's clear they've evolved from mere host and symbiote to something much deeper, and their dynamic was surprisingly touching, my personal experience with these two also comes as long as these three movies together, and as the movie itself whether it's better than the first one which also a good movie in my opinion, The Last Dance succeeded my expectation from being far from bad, i want this goodbye to be at least watchable enough, and the result is more than that, Venom: The Last Dance is actually a good film, just like Venom would say, We are Venom, and this film makes sure we feel it.",Negative
687,"Fun, wild, and hot mess. There's too much plot that's never explained. Events just happen randomly with no payoff, with a big action scene towards the end. Eddie & Venom Bromance is the savior of this trilogy. If you enjoy the others you will enjoy this.Synopsis:
In Venom: The Last Dance, Tom Hardy returns as Venom, one of Marvel's greatest and most complex characters, for the final film in the trilogy. Eddie and Venom are on the run. Hunted by both of their worlds and with the net closing in, the duo are forced into a devastating decision that will bring the curtains down on Venom and Eddie's last dance.",Positive
688,"If you were hoping for a grand finale to the Venom franchise that would surpass the comedic heights of its predecessors, you're in for a letdown. While Venom: The Last Dance does deliver on the comedic front, it falls short in nearly every other aspect.The film picks up right where we left off, with Eddie Brock and Venom still on the run. The plot takes a convoluted turn as they become embroiled in a government conspiracy involving symbiotes and a dangerous threat to the universe. While the premise is intriguing, the execution feels rushed and often confusing.The real draw of this film, as with its predecessors, is the chemistry between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom. Their banter and witty exchanges provide much-needed humor and keep the film entertaining. However, the comedic elements can feel forced at times, and the overall tone can be uneven.The film's biggest flaw is its reliance on poor CGI and even worse dialogue. The visual effects, particularly those involving the titular symbiote, often feel like a step back from previous entries. Venom's appearances are fleeting, and when he does appear in full form, he's often overshadowed by lackluster animation.The script is equally disappointing. The story lacks depth and originality, and the characters feel one-dimensional. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the pacing feels uneven. While there are a few moments of humor that might elicit a chuckle, they're not enough to salvage the film.Ultimately, Venom: The Last Dance is a missed opportunity. It's a shame that such a potentially fun franchise has ended on such a sour note.",Negative
689,"If cinematic catastrophes could have a mascot, this would be standing at the front of the line, waving its tattered flag of mediocrity. Tom Hardy's final outing as Eddie Brock/Venom is not just a disappointment-it's an insult to audiences everywhere. To call this movie bad would be a kindness. This is an incoherent, muddled, and utterly joyless mess that somehow manages to fall short of even the lowest expectations.The premise of Eddie and Venom being ""on the run"" from both worlds promised at least some thrilling action. Instead, what we get is a chaotic, poorly-scripted nightmare of disjointed scenes and absurd plot holes big enough to swallow the entire Marvel universe. The narrative, if you can call it that, lurches forward with all the grace of a drunken man stumbling in the dark. There is no rhyme or reason to the events that unfold. It's like the writers cobbled together every half-baked idea they could think of and hoped nobody would notice how little sense any of it makes.The so-called ""devastating decision"" that Eddie and Venom face feels less like a culmination of their journey and more like a cheap, hollow ploy to yank on the audience's emotions. But even that attempt falls flat because, by the time it arrives, the viewer is too exhausted from enduring 90 minutes of mindless drivel to care.Eddie Brock, once a complex and conflicted anti-hero from the source comics, is reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self, mumbling and stumbling through the film like he just wants to get it over with.The supporting characters are even worse-if that's possible. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use cardboard cutouts of side characters nobody cares about and clearly has no understanding of what made the earlier films (barely) work.They serve no purpose other than to waste screen time and remind us that, yes, someone actually wrote this drivel down on paper.It wouldn't be a Venom movie without over-the-top CGI battles, right? Well, unfortunately, the action scenes here are so poorly executed and short to save cost that even those who came purely for mindless entertainment will leave disappointed. The special effects are a headache-inducing blur of dark, indistinguishable shapes smashing into each other, with zero sense of tension or creativity.The final fight scene feels like -an unintelligible swirl of chaos that is supposed to distract us from the fact that nothing of consequence is happening. It's not exciting, it's not entertaining, it's just ugly.At its core it tries to sell itself as a dramatic, emotional farewell to Eddie and Venom's bond, but it doesn't even come close to achieving that. Any attempt at emotional weight is drowned by the film's clumsy pacing and complete lack of character development. The so-called ""devastating"" decision feels unearned, forced, and utterly unconvincing. There is no sense of closure, no satisfying payoff-just a hollow, empty finale that leaves you wondering why you wasted your time in the first place.Avoid this movie like the symbiote plague it is. Eddie and Venom deserved better. We all deserved better.Tom's ego and nepotism to promote his FWB director both of whom had sole credit of writing the script should tell you that how much he actually despises the franchise.Tom was the ultimate culprit is giving the first movie it's comic tone and had heated arguments with Ruben Flesicher on set to such an extent that filming halted for a few days. There were 3 script writers on the first movie can you guess who was one of them?It's the director of this movie who with her relationship strong armed and hijacked the plot elements and forced to introduce the comic tone into the first movie by reshooting the movie which had resulted in a disjointed mess.Even the Ruben had expressed his deep regrets about that but I guess if you can control the leading star you can have your way.If you closely look at the tone of the first movie first trailer you will notice the horror and science fiction elements present which had been stripped down to barebones and gag and quips reigned supreme.",Negative
690,"My wife and I watched Venom: The Last Dance (2024) last night in theaters. The storyline follows Eddie Brock, who is on the run from the law and hiding in Mexico. When an invasion from Venom's home world begins, Eddie must make his way to Area 51 to find reinforcements and fight off the invaders.Directed by Kelly Marcel in her directorial debut, the film stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Rhys Ifans (The Amazing Spider-Man), Stephen Graham (Snatch), and Juno Temple (Killer Joe).I absolutely loved the first two-thirds of this film. Tom Hardy nailed his role, bringing a perfect blend of humor, action, and Venom's signature appetite for chaos. The various forms Venom takes are visually entertaining, and the self-deprecating humor is spot-on. We especially enjoyed the introduction of a quirky ""hippie family,"" who added a fun twist. However, once the story shifts to Area 51, things feel rushed and forced. The other symbiotes look incredible, but they come and go so quickly that you're left wanting more. The villain's defeat also felt underwhelming, and I wanted a bit more depth in their storyline. The homage at the end felt somewhat awkward as well.In conclusion, Venom: The Last Dance is a fun watch and definitely worth seeing for fans of the character, though it doesn't quite reach its full potential. I'd rate it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Positive

692,"Venom 3 is fun movie. It will never be critically rated, but it doesn't need or try to be. It is fun, it is weird, it looks good and the interactions between Eddie and Venom are great as always and are funny unlike the forced jokes that don't always land. We get to see a bit more of the rest of the symbiotes, but it is not a major focus of the movie to introduce or highlight them, which was a bit disappointing personally. The storyline is a bit messy, and there are a few plotholes and illogical, unexplainable events, but the movie does a good job of actually taking the viewers through it. We get and ending to the trilogy that is pretty much what you expect, but the emotional charge of it feels a bit forced and doesn't let the viewer appreciate it for themselves. We also get a glimpse of what may come in the future, including a namedrop that comic fans will get, so we may see more of our goofy antihero in the future.",Positive
693,"Venom The Last Dance was hilarious, emotional and entertaining. Went in with the same expectations as before very low. I'm shocked about the critics, cause they expected much more unreal scenarios. Here again Sony is not stupid of course they'd have added a specific character in their world, but they probably can't because of a certain contract clause. The third movie is much better than the second cause the second movie suffered from extreme cuts which took out all its potential. Despite the fact that Venom was rumored and in productions ever since early 00s it's no wonder they made a trilogy and had box office success, cause Tom Hardy carried those movies on his own. Every other actor wouldn't be able to pull out this great chemistry between him and Venom. I'm not biased I see its flaws and weaknesses, but my God some critics thrashed this movie as if it's another Morbius or Madame Web. It's by far a better movie.The road trip family was adorable not necessary but there to add a more family atmosphere and emotional touch to this film. Juno Temple was good but underperformed and here background story was dragged into this movie.Ms Cheng was probably the best positive highlight of the movie besides the love for dogs and animals in general.A lot of great symbionts and designs were actually great to watch. I can't say much more to that point cause I want to avoid spoilers.The issuesThe plot and goal of the movie is clear but gets lost through the movie. The action sequences and CGI were average at best. I know that sounds awful for a higher rating, but hear me out. The cast was decent and some actors really shined here.Another problem is the camera work here too many fast cuts hardly to see specially when I think I was obligated to watch it in 3D. I prefer 2D.The biggest problem was there is no clear 1 v 1 villain here with heart and intentions. We have Knull as the big bad in the background but barely seen but only to bait us fans to watch it and another mystery character from the army or swat like crew not shown at all. Where as the first two movies had clear antagonists shown.Issue / or averageThe Ending was emotional and impactful with rushed bangs, but man there were some scenes I really felt touched by it. I still think they could've done more and Tom deserved more !I give it 6 but as a trilogy part and the Tom Hardy factor a light 7, cause reviews between 1-4 stars are harsh. And yeah don't leave there are two important post credit scenes. I'm really looking forward !",Positive

695,"Barely emotional. Barely funny. Barely mediocre. From this pattern, it can be deducted that Venom: The Last Dance is a passable movie that doesn't do enough right to feel like an epic send off, or do anything inherently wrong to be worth complaining about. It's just fine.Tom Hardy is once again the easy stand-out as Eddie Brock, using the same janky physical actions as Venom manipulates his movements to an entertaining degree. The humour is the same safe but fine lines of dialogue that either evoke a chuckle or short exhale of breath. The action scenes escalate in levels of excitement throughout the film, with the final act especially delivering some really fun mayhem. And being the supposed final film of the trilogy, there are some surprisingly tender moments sprinkled in, but aren't frequent enough to draw any real emotion.As aforementioned, the humour is fine but there's one particular segment of the film in Las Vegas that feels too ridiculous and reckless in the context of the movie. Moreover, the story sets up rules that either get contradicted, forgotten, or straight up ignored for the sake of 'cool' scenes. Aside from Eddie and Venom, the rest of the cast of characters come off as either underutilised, underdeveloped, or unnecessary. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rhys Ifans feel criminally wasted, Juno Temple and Clark Backo undermine each other as their characters could've been just compiled into one due to their similar traits, and Stephen Graham and Peggy Lu don't do much to feel properly utilised, especially Graham, who's character felt like was building up to a bigger pay-off than what we got. And the antagonist Knull was so sidelined that there's not much more to say about him other than 'he was in the movie'.In conclusion, for what Venom: The Last Dance can't deliver in a concise plot or compelling side characters, it manages to make up for it with fun symbiote action and mostly entertaining and semi-heartfelt sequences.",Negative
696,"Sony should publicly apologise to the audience for making this worst movie and make the audience suffer and wasted their time. So boring story, nothing to appreciate only actor (Tom Hardy) has done, good acting Else, everyone, not done anything to discuss, that's why am giving one star.Don't waste your money by going into the theatres. CGI was good, but story was so pathetic. You can just guess the whole picture by trailer waste of money. Tom Hardy should try superhero movies with other Studios sony is not good with superheroes. We have already seen this with Superman. Middle part was so boring and ending was too predictable.",Negative
697,"Venom: The Last Dance delivers exactly what it promises-an absurdly fun, high-octane ride with a surprising amount of heart. If you expected Avengers: Endgame level of finality, you walked into the wrong theater, but for those who wanted a dumb but entertaining alien-human bromance, this one's for you.This film is easily the best in the trilogy, blending sharp pacing, humor that actually lands, and action sequences that never feel forced. The weird yet charming dynamic between Eddie and Venom is in full swing, and the filmmakers know exactly how to tap into the ridiculous yet endearing relationship that has become the backbone of this series. It's self-aware without feeling desperate for laughs, striking a balance that's tough to nail in superhero movies these days.While some of the gore pushes the limits of PG-13, it's never gratuitous. There's enough bite to the violence to keep you hooked, but it stops short of being overwhelming. If anything, it adds a little edge to an otherwise slick, polished blockbuster.But the real kicker here is that, amidst all the chaos, Venom: The Last Dance sneaks in some genuine emotion. It's a film about keeping your best bro close, and somehow that works. So why all the hate? It's a popcorn flick that knows exactly what it is, and honestly, that's rare these days.",Positive
698,Almost the whole cast was full. The only cast members that helped was the family and of course the store lady. Mulligan was boring . I felt there was a power struggle when writing this. One wanted to show ase strong women yet made them look stupied and to emotional; while the other smart men but utterly useless in the long run causing more havoc and not thinking before moving.The CGI are as ok. The one creatures could have been way way more creative for sure.Over all it's a lack luster film unfortunately 😕..there's so much they could have done with Tom and this story line. We needed a version of him and Spider man yet have been robbed of that.,Negative
699,"First and foremost, it felt like the makers made every poor decision possible when it came to the sound tracks and music. That which is supposed to amplify the intensity of ride simply let it remain bland throughout, even the climax, even the falling action.With Venom and Eddie having largely ceased their bickering, their bromance has dwindled significantly in this movie. Being the conclusional piece of this hilarious trilogy, it has fallen short of many expectations.Of course there was some of those promised action as witnessed in the trailers. But was there something which swept me off my feet which was absent from the trailers? Not really.While the villain's back-story is rather solid, it could have been more centre-stage. Most of the characters that have made appearance in this movie felt weakly woven together; though the plot could not have moved forward without their roles, they barely left any impact. Speaking of the plot, it largely remains uneventful, with the makers just throwing a few name-sake 3D effect villainous creatures at our faces. There is only one major action sequence throughout the film, that it low-key has bottled down to something I would either skim through, or watch at a slightly increased playback speed.If the unnecessary scenes, and by that I mean, 'adding no humor or value to the plot' scenes were deleted, it could easily boil down to half its current run-time. That being said, there could definitely be leads from where this movie has left loose ends at, but presently, it stays far aloof from being involved in such a gifting.I feel like the last of the trilogy has not done justice to the previous two movies, it almost feels like watching a different character. The ending in particular came off to me as a tryhard terrific ending, and even if the clips were good, the track choices really did not work out for me.",Negative
700,"Eddie and Venom are on the run as fugitives after their battle with Carnage. They are chased by military force and aliens that want to capture them for their codex to unleash a greater evil in their world. Eddie and Venom venture out for a while avoiding authorities and the alien species.I am a fan of the first Venom movie. It is not a well-made movie, but it is so entertaining because of Tom Hardy's crazy performance in both roles and the wacky humor throughout the film. The second movie is much better made mainly because of Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris, but I actually enjoyed the first one more on a fun level. I was pretty excited for the third film and the trailers had me hooked. Does this trilogy end on a memorable last dance?I have mixed thoughts on Venom: The Last Dance. Let's start with the good. I love Eddie and Venom's dynamic and they are at their best in this movie. They have fun chemistry and banter and it feels like they are finally starting to get along with each other a bit better. They also have a few emotional moments that can come off as cheesy, but they have charm especially one scene where Eddie reassures Martin's son that his alien friend is there to help and Venom thanks the kid for a piece of chocolate. In a movie filled with silly moments and action-packed battles, it is a really sweet moment that shows how heroic Eddie and Venom have become.It helps that Tom Hardy is an absolute joy to watch. Hardy relishes in both of his roles and he never lets up. There are several moments of him doing stuff like going crazy at the slot machine and creating a drink at the bar by himself in a quick way. He also handles the more dramatic scenes very well making the more emotional moments work better than they should have.Also, Venom is a very cool character here. He is funny, his powers are awesome and he does anything to protect Eddie even knowing that if they are both alive the aliens will track them down because they have a codex. Venom's antics are very endearing and it seems like he just wants to join the fun and even tries to get Eddie to join in. I love watching him take control of other animals such as a horse, a fish and a frog. Venom is so much fun to watch and he is a good reason why I enjoy these movies despite their faults.The humor is for the most part pretty good. There is one gag that I cringed at but other than that, I got several laughs out of this movie. The banter between Eddie and Venom never gets old for me.The action scenes are pretty entertaining. The chase scene in the river is a standout because it looks cool, it has Eddie Brock defend himself without Venom and Venom turning into other creatures. It is also frenetic and fun to see play out. The climax is also big full of cool moments, but it is a little CGI heavy. However, it features Venom on a motorcycle again and it looks great. Overall, I enjoyed the action.The cinematography by Fabian Wagner is solid and colorful. The lighting is also on point with all of the scenes being lit well enough to see while having some flare in the shots. This is by far the best looking Venom movie filmmaking wise. The special effects are more polished and the alien creatures chasing Venom and Eddie look very menacing. Honestly, they kind of remind me of the Kaijus from Pacific Rim and I like that. There also other symbiotes in the film and they look very cool with their designs, but some of their colors blend in. The visuals are not perfect, but they are an upgrade from the last two movies.All that said, there are a few problems I have with this movie. The biggest problem is that the script is overstuffed. I know that there needs to other plot lines to have the story come together, but some of them do not work at all. The scientists subplot is one of the most boring parts of the movie with how slowly paced it is and how the tone shifts from fun to dreary and not the good kind of dreary. The subplot with Martin and his family is okay and has some great moments, but it can drag a little too long.The supporting cast does not hold a candle to Tom Hardy. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Rex Strickland is the best supporting performance, but his character is too unlikable to root for. Dr. Payne is kind of there until the climax. Clark Backo as Sadie Christmas is alright and she does a lot in the climax, but her character does not stand out until then. Rhys Ifans is having a lot of fun in his role as a family man who believes in aliens. While his family may have gotten a little more focus than they should have, Ifans is pretty fun to watch at times. Andy Serkis as Knull is absolutely wasted. He seems like a menacing villain, but he gets little to do aside from getting expository dialogue. By far, the weakest link in the film and wastes Andy Serkis on a limited role.The tone is all over the place. There are moments where this movie acts like a cheesy road trip comedy with Eddie and Venom and then the next scene could be overly serious research about the symbiotes. The movie progressively darker as it goes along and it has some moments that should come off as emotional and while they kind of work because of Tom Hardy's performance and the duo's likability, they feel a bit unearned because of how comedic this series is by now. When Eddie and Venom ponder the life they could have had when in the car with Martin's family, it is hard to feel anything because they have been two goofballs most of the time. Without spoiling anything, ending is a mixed bag for me because it is sad, but not a tearjerker like the movie wants it to be.The musical score by Dan Deacon makes no impression on me. It just sounds like generic music from any other movie. The needle drops are okay, but I wish they could find another song than Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. However, the credits song One Last Dance by Tom and Roman Morello and Grandson is really catchy and a great song to end the movie. Also, Maroon 5's Memories has a great needle drop here.Venom: The Last Dance is an entertaining movie. It is not well-made and not even as fun as the first film, but I overall had a pretty good time with the movie despite the many issues it has. I guess I cannot help but find Eddie and Venom a lot of fun to watch. Director Kelly Marcel did a great job with the scenes with those two and with the action scenes, but I think she bit off more than she could chew with the other subplots. If you like the Venom movies, you will probably enjoy this movie but if you never them then this movie will not change your mind.Stay through all of the credits.",Positive
701,"It is genuinely impressive that Sony managed to make the most mediocre trilogy ever with such an iconic character.In terms of enjoyment, Eddie and Venom continue to be a delightfully fun duo. In this 3rd movie, they are basically on a road trip and that was relatively entertaining for the most part. The final act of the movie was also a pretty enjoyable CGI action fest with some emotional scenes.However, the story and script are still as flat as ever. The narrative feels very half baked with it feeling like a chain of things just randomly happening. Pointless characters that don't add much. Jokes being thrown at you just to see which land. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor characters could have been played by anyone but feels purposely done because they knew fans recognised them from other Marvel projects. The villain Knull looks cool but is just there to be teased for future projects.Overall, it is better than the second film but just on par with the first. It is a mediocre final entry. Sony continues to disappoint with their universe and We all know Venom is coming back somehow. I do worry for Spiderman 4 and hope Sony don't mess that movie in anyway.",Neutral
702,"""Venom: The Last Dance' is a messy buddy road trip in which you must turn your brains off...again.Is it perfect? Nah, far from it. I think there are way too many storylines in here, and the main one got some potential, but it was wasted in typical Sony fashion. The ""Spider-Man 4"" rumors have been blown out of proportion in my opinion, so temper your expectations.The duo between Eddie and Venom is as fun as always. I mean Tom Hardy and the banter between them...I'm sorry, the banter between Hardy and himself is the best part of these movies (Hardy is doing the voice of Venom).The humor is there, but can't say I laughed all that much, beacause most of the jokes are base level childish again. It must be a bit more emotional as a whole, because supposedly is the last time we see Venom (hardly doubt), but it ends up kinda hollow.Knull is there...I guess, but will see how and when they'll use him again...it's Sony after all.It's a popcorn movie that reminds me of the early 2000's comic book movies. The action in the third act is good for the most parts and there are some funny moments here and there. Are there plot holes and some issues with the story? Yes. It's just another ""Turn your brains off"" Sony movie again.There are two credit scenes, first one is kinda important, the second one not so much.",Positive
703,"My relationship with the Venom franchise has been rocky. I have a soft spot for the first one, absolutely loathe the second, and now we come to the trilogy's closer, and thankfully, it's an improvement.Venom: The Last Dance works best when it focuses on Eddie and Venom's story instead of trying to set up the future of the Sonyverse. If you didn't like the previous Venom films, this won't change your mind. It's still messy, but it gets more right than its predecessors.This is easily the campiest and most mature of the bunch. It takes its time with the characters, letting us sit with them instead of rushing into the next action set piece. Still being PG-13 it manages to cram in a lot more gore than its predecessors. The action is inventive, and the humor hits its mark. It also doesn't shy away from getting personal and emotional. Eddie and Venom's relationship has never felt more genuine. I'll admit-I teared up a few times by the end.Some may be disappointed by the potrayal of Knull, but personally, I loved it. He feels like an overlooming threat rather than an one-off villain, and the ""God of Darkness"" gets a Thanos-esque treatment he deserves.Now, don't get me wrong-the movie is still bad, technically speaking-but it's self-aware about that. Instead of being ""bad bad,"" it chooses to be ""fun bad"" and entertain you, and I respect that. Not every movie needs to be great; sometimes being fun is enough.Even with the lows, I have always found a weird sense of comfort with this rendition of Venom. I have found myself caring more for these characters than maybe even the script intended. So I am happy to say that by the end, it does enough to justify this trilogy's existence - and to such an satisfying extent that I'd rather live in a world where the Venom movies exist than one where it doesn't.",Positive
704,"The third installment about the symbiotic anti-hero is a mix of bright moments and disappointments. Tom Hardy once again proves why he is the perfect choice for the role of Eddie Brock/Venom, but even his charismatic performance cannot save the unbalanced ensemble. The film starts off promisingly - with dynamic action and witty dialogue between Eddie and his symbiotic companion. Their relationship is still the best the series has to offer. Hardy brilliantly manages both comedic timing and dramatic moments. The visual effects are impressive in places, especially in the action sequences where Venom shows off his abilities. At other times, however, the CGI feels inadequate and more reminiscent of a video game from the last decade. Some fights are well choreographed, others are a chaotic mix of digital effects. The biggest problem is the script, which tries to be too ambitious. It mixes several storylines, introduces new characters and antagonists, but does not give them enough space to develop. The result is a rushed pace and superficial characters. The film's darker tone is a welcome change, but it often clashes with the comedic elements, creating an unbalanced whole. The film seems unsure whether it wants to be a serious drama or a lighthearted entertainment. Venom: The Last Dance is like a roller coaster - it's ups and downs. For fans of the series, it offers enough fun, but it's hard to call it a significant step forward. This film is like an average song on a great album, but as a whole it doesn't leave a strong impression. Fans will find their own, others may be disappointed.",Positive
705,"Maybe it's just because of my low expectations toward the series but it was just fun to watch. I've already lost hope for the trilogy to have a decent plot but I can say that this one has a better storyline than the second film.CGI was fine, I coudn't find any disturbing point. It was interesting to see the other symbiotes. I think those new symbiotes showed more symbiote-ish action scenes than venom when it comes to the fight ironically.There were a few funny jokes that made me laugh but I didn't really find Eddie's weird obsession for shoes funny, like was it supposed to be funny? Guess it was meant to be humor but well... it was almost tiring.",Neutral
706,"A solid enough send off for this 'Venom' trilogy.'Venom: The Last Dance' is decently amusing and produces enough entertainment with its plot. I didn't personally find it overly funny, though the person a few seats across from me had an absolute blast - never a bad thing seeing people enjoy themselves!Tom Hardy remains the key element of these films, they would be far less enjoyable without his presence. There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor stick out most from the other characters.",Negative

708,"Being Rated R probably would have saved this; I am just saying!This trilogy-capper almost makes me question if I have become more of a movie critic than a movie enjoyer. Then I remembered this is Sony's Spider-Man Universe we are talking about, which gave us films like ""Morbius"" and ""Madame Web."" I nonetheless went in here with an open mind, considering I do not mind the two previous ""Venom"" films that came out. After seeing ""The Last Dance,"" I question whether Sony was trying to set up their universe or give Eddie Brock and Venom the send-off they deserve. I am sadly leaning more toward the former.I should preface this review by telling you what I thought of the other two ""Venom"" films upon rewatch in preparation for this third installment. Those were entertaining yet disappointing superhero films saved by the performance of Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and Venom. The first was innocent enough, with a dull first and more engaging second half, a weak villain in Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake/Riot, exciting action, and Hardy performing nicely. Its sequel, ""Let There Be Carnage,"" surprisingly got better when revisiting it, easily surpassing its predecessor, with Hardy allowed to stretch his comedic abilities with Brock and Venom bickering hilariously. In addition, there is Woody Harrelson's enjoyable performance as Cletus Kasady/Carnage, who manages to rise above the flaws, including the disappointing inclusion of Naomie Harris' Frances Barrison/Shriek. Hardy was allowed to have fun with his characters, and the movies complimented him with a narrative that was not too complicated. The opposite is true for ""The Last Dance.""Let's get the positives out of the way first. It is a short list, which I am deeply saddened by, but I want to show you how it is not the worst superhero film out there or even the worst film of the year.Despite a woeful screenplay, Tom Hardy still does skillfully with Eddie Brock and Venom. He is not allowed to have as much fun as he did in the prior two films, but he is trying his best (right, the positives. Sorry).The rest of the cast delivered equally solid performances, with the other standout being Chiwetel Ejiofor as Orwell Taylor. Ejiofor always has a commanding presence whenever he is in a movie, with his characters of Baron Mordo in the two ""Doctor Strange"" films and Bathurst 2020 in the forgettable ""Infinite"" being the two I can think of at the top of my head. Even if the film is not the best, Ejiofor makes it work, and if it is fantastic, he always steals the show.The visual effects bring Venom and the other alien characters to gorgeous life. The other two ""Venom"" movies, granted, had remarkable CGI, but it is worth mentioning, specifically when discussing the positives.The action is somewhat fun. The ""Venom"" movies have always had enjoyable action. Unfortunately, ""The Last Dance"" was the least fun action-wise, but the first scene with action was sweet.The Venom symbiote is sometimes uniquely utilized. The trailers showcased Venom controlling a horse, and in the film, it is one of its best scenes. I am unsure if this is a spoiler, but he controls other animals, and they introduce other symbiotes, which is fun.I think that is it for the positives.I felt the portrayal of Eddie Brock and Venom this time was not good. Again, Hardy tried, but there were multiple times when it felt like he was bored. His character was, admittedly, bored at intervals, and Hardy is a screenwriter, but I am saying how it felt.The film tries to add new characters, but they are not compelling. The most obvious example is Dr. Payne, played by Juno Temple, who does nothing aside from believing that Brock is not a danger, while Ejiofor wants what is best for the world, considering the alien threat from Knull.Speaking of Knull, he was worse than Carlton Drake. He only sends alien minions to grab a MacGuffin that Venom has. I have not read the comics, but the impression I get from others and this movie is that Knull has a profound lore not represented here. Having Knull's alien pals and the Area 51 agents as the villains is too much, yet somehow too little.They also wasted Stephen Graham's Detective Mulligan. The trailers made it seem like Mulligan would be a principal and intriguing character. The only two interesting aspects about Mulligan are he has a symbiote and warns of Knull. That is it.Furthermore, it does not have that much comedy. ""Let There Be Carnage"" can easily be classified as a comedy, and I laughed more than I would like to admit. I think two laughs and three to five chuckles were all I had here. The film was not funny outside of the Venom horse and some banter between Brock and Venom.On top of that, there was not that much emotion. It is due to how much Brock and Venom were not well utilized and the clutter of characters. I did not care about the Area 51 personnel nor the unnamed family who brought Brock and Venom to Vegas. When the ending came along, which heightened the stakes to an unbelievable degree, I did not get emotional. It tried, but it failed to work.The other two ""Venom"" movies were entertaining, but this failed to come close. In an era where ""superhero fatigue"" is becoming more accepted, this trilogy-closer did not try anything new. Fascinating concepts here and there, and many standout scenes fail to save this disappointment in a franchise filled with them.Technically, a 6/10. Outside of the plot and the underwhelming screenplay, the visual effects remain exceptional, the actors did great, and the film functions.For the enjoyment score, I wanted to like this film. I had the sneaking suspicion that it might not work, but watching ""Let There Be Carnage"" increase in quality gave me hope. It was no ""Let There Be Carnage"" and is easily the weakest of the trilogy. It had the issues that plagued the likes of ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but does not come close to being as entertaining as them. I am so unhappy that the enjoyment score is a 4/10, but this trilogy deserved a better conclusion. Maybe it will get better when I watch it again, but as it stands, it is best for me to recommend you wait until Netflix or even Disney+.",Positive
709,"This movie was very middle of the road to me. Definitely better than the second one, but not as good as the original.I enjoyed the beginning very much. Nice pace, good story and funny at times. Also the last part was packed with action and it all looked amazing. Only thing I missed was some sort of a climax at the very end.The middle however, I did not care for too much. Some things felt forced, rushed and very unlikely. But as I often say in my reviews: 'It is a fictional, fantasy, action movie so who cares if some things do not add up.'As a whole I enjoyed it very much, Tom Hardy did not disappoint.",Positive
710,"I just don't get it, I thought the 1st Venom was good despite many fans may not have liked it. I'm not a comic fan, so for me it was good that they try to make it as relatable and realistic to just your average movie goer.The 2nd film was cringy and terrible in my opinion because the story didn't make much sense, too much drama, poetry, and bromance. I lost interest after watching that one but the trailer for this film looked good.Right from the beginning I realize this was going to be bad. I don't care about the multi-verse, I don't care about Knull, I don't care about all these comic lores. The story is completely unrelatable and the suspension of disbelief failed early on.And then to top it off, the ending was just awful.4/10 for the special effects. Everything else is a 0.",Negative
711,"If you've already come to terms with this version of Venom and Eddie Brock as more of a bromance than the savage, brutal duo from the comics, you're in for a fun ride, Venom: The Last Dance, the final chapter of the trilogy, delivers an entertaining ride with solid pacing, good performances, decent visual effects, and fun engaging enough story, added also with the joy of let all the madness fan service out makes Venom: The Last Dance an easy good time especially for me, even the serious part mostly with Chiwetel Ejiofor was executed pretty well, surprising wholesome moments with Rhys Ifans and his family characters, flawed? Sure, some of the editing cuts didn't quite work for me, there were a few cheesy, awkward moments that felt off, and nit picky here and there, overall, i have a good time with Venom: The Last Dance, and the most surprising thing also the least thing i could expect watching this supposed to be last time we'll see both Venom and Eddie was that i did get quite emotional at the end, it's clear they've evolved from mere host and symbiote to something much deeper, and their dynamic was surprisingly touching, my personal experience with these two also comes as long as these three movies together, and as the movie itself whether it's better than the first one which also a good movie in my opinion, The Last Dance succeeded my expectation from being far from bad, i want this goodbye to be at least watchable enough, and the result is more than that, Venom: The Last Dance is actually a good film, just like Venom would say, We are Venom, and this film makes sure we feel it.",Negative
712,"Fun, wild, and hot mess. There's too much plot that's never explained. Events just happen randomly with no payoff, with a big action scene towards the end. Eddie & Venom Bromance is the savior of this trilogy. If you enjoy the others you will enjoy this.Synopsis:
In Venom: The Last Dance, Tom Hardy returns as Venom, one of Marvel's greatest and most complex characters, for the final film in the trilogy. Eddie and Venom are on the run. Hunted by both of their worlds and with the net closing in, the duo are forced into a devastating decision that will bring the curtains down on Venom and Eddie's last dance.",Positive
713,"If you were hoping for a grand finale to the Venom franchise that would surpass the comedic heights of its predecessors, you're in for a letdown. While Venom: The Last Dance does deliver on the comedic front, it falls short in nearly every other aspect.The film picks up right where we left off, with Eddie Brock and Venom still on the run. The plot takes a convoluted turn as they become embroiled in a government conspiracy involving symbiotes and a dangerous threat to the universe. While the premise is intriguing, the execution feels rushed and often confusing.The real draw of this film, as with its predecessors, is the chemistry between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom. Their banter and witty exchanges provide much-needed humor and keep the film entertaining. However, the comedic elements can feel forced at times, and the overall tone can be uneven.The film's biggest flaw is its reliance on poor CGI and even worse dialogue. The visual effects, particularly those involving the titular symbiote, often feel like a step back from previous entries. Venom's appearances are fleeting, and when he does appear in full form, he's often overshadowed by lackluster animation.The script is equally disappointing. The story lacks depth and originality, and the characters feel one-dimensional. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the pacing feels uneven. While there are a few moments of humor that might elicit a chuckle, they're not enough to salvage the film.Ultimately, Venom: The Last Dance is a missed opportunity. It's a shame that such a potentially fun franchise has ended on such a sour note.",Negative
714,"If cinematic catastrophes could have a mascot, this would be standing at the front of the line, waving its tattered flag of mediocrity. Tom Hardy's final outing as Eddie Brock/Venom is not just a disappointment-it's an insult to audiences everywhere. To call this movie bad would be a kindness. This is an incoherent, muddled, and utterly joyless mess that somehow manages to fall short of even the lowest expectations.The premise of Eddie and Venom being ""on the run"" from both worlds promised at least some thrilling action. Instead, what we get is a chaotic, poorly-scripted nightmare of disjointed scenes and absurd plot holes big enough to swallow the entire Marvel universe. The narrative, if you can call it that, lurches forward with all the grace of a drunken man stumbling in the dark. There is no rhyme or reason to the events that unfold. It's like the writers cobbled together every half-baked idea they could think of and hoped nobody would notice how little sense any of it makes.The so-called ""devastating decision"" that Eddie and Venom face feels less like a culmination of their journey and more like a cheap, hollow ploy to yank on the audience's emotions. But even that attempt falls flat because, by the time it arrives, the viewer is too exhausted from enduring 90 minutes of mindless drivel to care.Eddie Brock, once a complex and conflicted anti-hero from the source comics, is reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self, mumbling and stumbling through the film like he just wants to get it over with.The supporting characters are even worse-if that's possible. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use cardboard cutouts of side characters nobody cares about and clearly has no understanding of what made the earlier films (barely) work.They serve no purpose other than to waste screen time and remind us that, yes, someone actually wrote this drivel down on paper.It wouldn't be a Venom movie without over-the-top CGI battles, right? Well, unfortunately, the action scenes here are so poorly executed and short to save cost that even those who came purely for mindless entertainment will leave disappointed. The special effects are a headache-inducing blur of dark, indistinguishable shapes smashing into each other, with zero sense of tension or creativity.The final fight scene feels like -an unintelligible swirl of chaos that is supposed to distract us from the fact that nothing of consequence is happening. It's not exciting, it's not entertaining, it's just ugly.At its core it tries to sell itself as a dramatic, emotional farewell to Eddie and Venom's bond, but it doesn't even come close to achieving that. Any attempt at emotional weight is drowned by the film's clumsy pacing and complete lack of character development. The so-called ""devastating"" decision feels unearned, forced, and utterly unconvincing. There is no sense of closure, no satisfying payoff-just a hollow, empty finale that leaves you wondering why you wasted your time in the first place.Avoid this movie like the symbiote plague it is. Eddie and Venom deserved better. We all deserved better.Tom's ego and nepotism to promote his FWB director both of whom had sole credit of writing the script should tell you that how much he actually despises the franchise.Tom was the ultimate culprit is giving the first movie it's comic tone and had heated arguments with Ruben Flesicher on set to such an extent that filming halted for a few days. There were 3 script writers on the first movie can you guess who was one of them?It's the director of this movie who with her relationship strong armed and hijacked the plot elements and forced to introduce the comic tone into the first movie by reshooting the movie which had resulted in a disjointed mess.Even the Ruben had expressed his deep regrets about that but I guess if you can control the leading star you can have your way.If you closely look at the tone of the first movie first trailer you will notice the horror and science fiction elements present which had been stripped down to barebones and gag and quips reigned supreme.",Negative
715,"My wife and I watched Venom: The Last Dance (2024) last night in theaters. The storyline follows Eddie Brock, who is on the run from the law and hiding in Mexico. When an invasion from Venom's home world begins, Eddie must make his way to Area 51 to find reinforcements and fight off the invaders.Directed by Kelly Marcel in her directorial debut, the film stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Rhys Ifans (The Amazing Spider-Man), Stephen Graham (Snatch), and Juno Temple (Killer Joe).I absolutely loved the first two-thirds of this film. Tom Hardy nailed his role, bringing a perfect blend of humor, action, and Venom's signature appetite for chaos. The various forms Venom takes are visually entertaining, and the self-deprecating humor is spot-on. We especially enjoyed the introduction of a quirky ""hippie family,"" who added a fun twist. However, once the story shifts to Area 51, things feel rushed and forced. The other symbiotes look incredible, but they come and go so quickly that you're left wanting more. The villain's defeat also felt underwhelming, and I wanted a bit more depth in their storyline. The homage at the end felt somewhat awkward as well.In conclusion, Venom: The Last Dance is a fun watch and definitely worth seeing for fans of the character, though it doesn't quite reach its full potential. I'd rate it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Positive

717,"Venom 3 is fun movie. It will never be critically rated, but it doesn't need or try to be. It is fun, it is weird, it looks good and the interactions between Eddie and Venom are great as always and are funny unlike the forced jokes that don't always land. We get to see a bit more of the rest of the symbiotes, but it is not a major focus of the movie to introduce or highlight them, which was a bit disappointing personally. The storyline is a bit messy, and there are a few plotholes and illogical, unexplainable events, but the movie does a good job of actually taking the viewers through it. We get and ending to the trilogy that is pretty much what you expect, but the emotional charge of it feels a bit forced and doesn't let the viewer appreciate it for themselves. We also get a glimpse of what may come in the future, including a namedrop that comic fans will get, so we may see more of our goofy antihero in the future.",Positive
718,"Venom The Last Dance was hilarious, emotional and entertaining. Went in with the same expectations as before very low. I'm shocked about the critics, cause they expected much more unreal scenarios. Here again Sony is not stupid of course they'd have added a specific character in their world, but they probably can't because of a certain contract clause. The third movie is much better than the second cause the second movie suffered from extreme cuts which took out all its potential. Despite the fact that Venom was rumored and in productions ever since early 00s it's no wonder they made a trilogy and had box office success, cause Tom Hardy carried those movies on his own. Every other actor wouldn't be able to pull out this great chemistry between him and Venom. I'm not biased I see its flaws and weaknesses, but my God some critics thrashed this movie as if it's another Morbius or Madame Web. It's by far a better movie.The road trip family was adorable not necessary but there to add a more family atmosphere and emotional touch to this film. Juno Temple was good but underperformed and here background story was dragged into this movie.Ms Cheng was probably the best positive highlight of the movie besides the love for dogs and animals in general.A lot of great symbionts and designs were actually great to watch. I can't say much more to that point cause I want to avoid spoilers.The issuesThe plot and goal of the movie is clear but gets lost through the movie. The action sequences and CGI were average at best. I know that sounds awful for a higher rating, but hear me out. The cast was decent and some actors really shined here.Another problem is the camera work here too many fast cuts hardly to see specially when I think I was obligated to watch it in 3D. I prefer 2D.The biggest problem was there is no clear 1 v 1 villain here with heart and intentions. We have Knull as the big bad in the background but barely seen but only to bait us fans to watch it and another mystery character from the army or swat like crew not shown at all. Where as the first two movies had clear antagonists shown.Issue / or averageThe Ending was emotional and impactful with rushed bangs, but man there were some scenes I really felt touched by it. I still think they could've done more and Tom deserved more !I give it 6 but as a trilogy part and the Tom Hardy factor a light 7, cause reviews between 1-4 stars are harsh. And yeah don't leave there are two important post credit scenes. I'm really looking forward !",Positive

720,"Barely emotional. Barely funny. Barely mediocre. From this pattern, it can be deducted that Venom: The Last Dance is a passable movie that doesn't do enough right to feel like an epic send off, or do anything inherently wrong to be worth complaining about. It's just fine.Tom Hardy is once again the easy stand-out as Eddie Brock, using the same janky physical actions as Venom manipulates his movements to an entertaining degree. The humour is the same safe but fine lines of dialogue that either evoke a chuckle or short exhale of breath. The action scenes escalate in levels of excitement throughout the film, with the final act especially delivering some really fun mayhem. And being the supposed final film of the trilogy, there are some surprisingly tender moments sprinkled in, but aren't frequent enough to draw any real emotion.As aforementioned, the humour is fine but there's one particular segment of the film in Las Vegas that feels too ridiculous and reckless in the context of the movie. Moreover, the story sets up rules that either get contradicted, forgotten, or straight up ignored for the sake of 'cool' scenes. Aside from Eddie and Venom, the rest of the cast of characters come off as either underutilised, underdeveloped, or unnecessary. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rhys Ifans feel criminally wasted, Juno Temple and Clark Backo undermine each other as their characters could've been just compiled into one due to their similar traits, and Stephen Graham and Peggy Lu don't do much to feel properly utilised, especially Graham, who's character felt like was building up to a bigger pay-off than what we got. And the antagonist Knull was so sidelined that there's not much more to say about him other than 'he was in the movie'.In conclusion, for what Venom: The Last Dance can't deliver in a concise plot or compelling side characters, it manages to make up for it with fun symbiote action and mostly entertaining and semi-heartfelt sequences.",Negative
721,"Sony should publicly apologise to the audience for making this worst movie and make the audience suffer and wasted their time. So boring story, nothing to appreciate only actor (Tom Hardy) has done, good acting Else, everyone, not done anything to discuss, that's why am giving one star.Don't waste your money by going into the theatres. CGI was good, but story was so pathetic. You can just guess the whole picture by trailer waste of money. Tom Hardy should try superhero movies with other Studios sony is not good with superheroes. We have already seen this with Superman. Middle part was so boring and ending was too predictable.",Negative
722,"Venom: The Last Dance delivers exactly what it promises-an absurdly fun, high-octane ride with a surprising amount of heart. If you expected Avengers: Endgame level of finality, you walked into the wrong theater, but for those who wanted a dumb but entertaining alien-human bromance, this one's for you.This film is easily the best in the trilogy, blending sharp pacing, humor that actually lands, and action sequences that never feel forced. The weird yet charming dynamic between Eddie and Venom is in full swing, and the filmmakers know exactly how to tap into the ridiculous yet endearing relationship that has become the backbone of this series. It's self-aware without feeling desperate for laughs, striking a balance that's tough to nail in superhero movies these days.While some of the gore pushes the limits of PG-13, it's never gratuitous. There's enough bite to the violence to keep you hooked, but it stops short of being overwhelming. If anything, it adds a little edge to an otherwise slick, polished blockbuster.But the real kicker here is that, amidst all the chaos, Venom: The Last Dance sneaks in some genuine emotion. It's a film about keeping your best bro close, and somehow that works. So why all the hate? It's a popcorn flick that knows exactly what it is, and honestly, that's rare these days.",Positive
723,Almost the whole cast was full. The only cast members that helped was the family and of course the store lady. Mulligan was boring . I felt there was a power struggle when writing this. One wanted to show ase strong women yet made them look stupied and to emotional; while the other smart men but utterly useless in the long run causing more havoc and not thinking before moving.The CGI are as ok. The one creatures could have been way way more creative for sure.Over all it's a lack luster film unfortunately 😕..there's so much they could have done with Tom and this story line. We needed a version of him and Spider man yet have been robbed of that.,Negative
724,"First and foremost, it felt like the makers made every poor decision possible when it came to the sound tracks and music. That which is supposed to amplify the intensity of ride simply let it remain bland throughout, even the climax, even the falling action.With Venom and Eddie having largely ceased their bickering, their bromance has dwindled significantly in this movie. Being the conclusional piece of this hilarious trilogy, it has fallen short of many expectations.Of course there was some of those promised action as witnessed in the trailers. But was there something which swept me off my feet which was absent from the trailers? Not really.While the villain's back-story is rather solid, it could have been more centre-stage. Most of the characters that have made appearance in this movie felt weakly woven together; though the plot could not have moved forward without their roles, they barely left any impact. Speaking of the plot, it largely remains uneventful, with the makers just throwing a few name-sake 3D effect villainous creatures at our faces. There is only one major action sequence throughout the film, that it low-key has bottled down to something I would either skim through, or watch at a slightly increased playback speed.If the unnecessary scenes, and by that I mean, 'adding no humor or value to the plot' scenes were deleted, it could easily boil down to half its current run-time. That being said, there could definitely be leads from where this movie has left loose ends at, but presently, it stays far aloof from being involved in such a gifting.I feel like the last of the trilogy has not done justice to the previous two movies, it almost feels like watching a different character. The ending in particular came off to me as a tryhard terrific ending, and even if the clips were good, the track choices really did not work out for me.",Negative
725,"Eddie and Venom are on the run as fugitives after their battle with Carnage. They are chased by military force and aliens that want to capture them for their codex to unleash a greater evil in their world. Eddie and Venom venture out for a while avoiding authorities and the alien species.I am a fan of the first Venom movie. It is not a well-made movie, but it is so entertaining because of Tom Hardy's crazy performance in both roles and the wacky humor throughout the film. The second movie is much better made mainly because of Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris, but I actually enjoyed the first one more on a fun level. I was pretty excited for the third film and the trailers had me hooked. Does this trilogy end on a memorable last dance?I have mixed thoughts on Venom: The Last Dance. Let's start with the good. I love Eddie and Venom's dynamic and they are at their best in this movie. They have fun chemistry and banter and it feels like they are finally starting to get along with each other a bit better. They also have a few emotional moments that can come off as cheesy, but they have charm especially one scene where Eddie reassures Martin's son that his alien friend is there to help and Venom thanks the kid for a piece of chocolate. In a movie filled with silly moments and action-packed battles, it is a really sweet moment that shows how heroic Eddie and Venom have become.It helps that Tom Hardy is an absolute joy to watch. Hardy relishes in both of his roles and he never lets up. There are several moments of him doing stuff like going crazy at the slot machine and creating a drink at the bar by himself in a quick way. He also handles the more dramatic scenes very well making the more emotional moments work better than they should have.Also, Venom is a very cool character here. He is funny, his powers are awesome and he does anything to protect Eddie even knowing that if they are both alive the aliens will track them down because they have a codex. Venom's antics are very endearing and it seems like he just wants to join the fun and even tries to get Eddie to join in. I love watching him take control of other animals such as a horse, a fish and a frog. Venom is so much fun to watch and he is a good reason why I enjoy these movies despite their faults.The humor is for the most part pretty good. There is one gag that I cringed at but other than that, I got several laughs out of this movie. The banter between Eddie and Venom never gets old for me.The action scenes are pretty entertaining. The chase scene in the river is a standout because it looks cool, it has Eddie Brock defend himself without Venom and Venom turning into other creatures. It is also frenetic and fun to see play out. The climax is also big full of cool moments, but it is a little CGI heavy. However, it features Venom on a motorcycle again and it looks great. Overall, I enjoyed the action.The cinematography by Fabian Wagner is solid and colorful. The lighting is also on point with all of the scenes being lit well enough to see while having some flare in the shots. This is by far the best looking Venom movie filmmaking wise. The special effects are more polished and the alien creatures chasing Venom and Eddie look very menacing. Honestly, they kind of remind me of the Kaijus from Pacific Rim and I like that. There also other symbiotes in the film and they look very cool with their designs, but some of their colors blend in. The visuals are not perfect, but they are an upgrade from the last two movies.All that said, there are a few problems I have with this movie. The biggest problem is that the script is overstuffed. I know that there needs to other plot lines to have the story come together, but some of them do not work at all. The scientists subplot is one of the most boring parts of the movie with how slowly paced it is and how the tone shifts from fun to dreary and not the good kind of dreary. The subplot with Martin and his family is okay and has some great moments, but it can drag a little too long.The supporting cast does not hold a candle to Tom Hardy. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Rex Strickland is the best supporting performance, but his character is too unlikable to root for. Dr. Payne is kind of there until the climax. Clark Backo as Sadie Christmas is alright and she does a lot in the climax, but her character does not stand out until then. Rhys Ifans is having a lot of fun in his role as a family man who believes in aliens. While his family may have gotten a little more focus than they should have, Ifans is pretty fun to watch at times. Andy Serkis as Knull is absolutely wasted. He seems like a menacing villain, but he gets little to do aside from getting expository dialogue. By far, the weakest link in the film and wastes Andy Serkis on a limited role.The tone is all over the place. There are moments where this movie acts like a cheesy road trip comedy with Eddie and Venom and then the next scene could be overly serious research about the symbiotes. The movie progressively darker as it goes along and it has some moments that should come off as emotional and while they kind of work because of Tom Hardy's performance and the duo's likability, they feel a bit unearned because of how comedic this series is by now. When Eddie and Venom ponder the life they could have had when in the car with Martin's family, it is hard to feel anything because they have been two goofballs most of the time. Without spoiling anything, ending is a mixed bag for me because it is sad, but not a tearjerker like the movie wants it to be.The musical score by Dan Deacon makes no impression on me. It just sounds like generic music from any other movie. The needle drops are okay, but I wish they could find another song than Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. However, the credits song One Last Dance by Tom and Roman Morello and Grandson is really catchy and a great song to end the movie. Also, Maroon 5's Memories has a great needle drop here.Venom: The Last Dance is an entertaining movie. It is not well-made and not even as fun as the first film, but I overall had a pretty good time with the movie despite the many issues it has. I guess I cannot help but find Eddie and Venom a lot of fun to watch. Director Kelly Marcel did a great job with the scenes with those two and with the action scenes, but I think she bit off more than she could chew with the other subplots. If you like the Venom movies, you will probably enjoy this movie but if you never them then this movie will not change your mind.Stay through all of the credits.",Positive
726,"It is genuinely impressive that Sony managed to make the most mediocre trilogy ever with such an iconic character.In terms of enjoyment, Eddie and Venom continue to be a delightfully fun duo. In this 3rd movie, they are basically on a road trip and that was relatively entertaining for the most part. The final act of the movie was also a pretty enjoyable CGI action fest with some emotional scenes.However, the story and script are still as flat as ever. The narrative feels very half baked with it feeling like a chain of things just randomly happening. Pointless characters that don't add much. Jokes being thrown at you just to see which land. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor characters could have been played by anyone but feels purposely done because they knew fans recognised them from other Marvel projects. The villain Knull looks cool but is just there to be teased for future projects.Overall, it is better than the second film but just on par with the first. It is a mediocre final entry. Sony continues to disappoint with their universe and We all know Venom is coming back somehow. I do worry for Spiderman 4 and hope Sony don't mess that movie in anyway.",Neutral
727,"""Venom: The Last Dance' is a messy buddy road trip in which you must turn your brains off...again.Is it perfect? Nah, far from it. I think there are way too many storylines in here, and the main one got some potential, but it was wasted in typical Sony fashion. The ""Spider-Man 4"" rumors have been blown out of proportion in my opinion, so temper your expectations.The duo between Eddie and Venom is as fun as always. I mean Tom Hardy and the banter between them...I'm sorry, the banter between Hardy and himself is the best part of these movies (Hardy is doing the voice of Venom).The humor is there, but can't say I laughed all that much, beacause most of the jokes are base level childish again. It must be a bit more emotional as a whole, because supposedly is the last time we see Venom (hardly doubt), but it ends up kinda hollow.Knull is there...I guess, but will see how and when they'll use him again...it's Sony after all.It's a popcorn movie that reminds me of the early 2000's comic book movies. The action in the third act is good for the most parts and there are some funny moments here and there. Are there plot holes and some issues with the story? Yes. It's just another ""Turn your brains off"" Sony movie again.There are two credit scenes, first one is kinda important, the second one not so much.",Positive
728,"My relationship with the Venom franchise has been rocky. I have a soft spot for the first one, absolutely loathe the second, and now we come to the trilogy's closer, and thankfully, it's an improvement.Venom: The Last Dance works best when it focuses on Eddie and Venom's story instead of trying to set up the future of the Sonyverse. If you didn't like the previous Venom films, this won't change your mind. It's still messy, but it gets more right than its predecessors.This is easily the campiest and most mature of the bunch. It takes its time with the characters, letting us sit with them instead of rushing into the next action set piece. Still being PG-13 it manages to cram in a lot more gore than its predecessors. The action is inventive, and the humor hits its mark. It also doesn't shy away from getting personal and emotional. Eddie and Venom's relationship has never felt more genuine. I'll admit-I teared up a few times by the end.Some may be disappointed by the potrayal of Knull, but personally, I loved it. He feels like an overlooming threat rather than an one-off villain, and the ""God of Darkness"" gets a Thanos-esque treatment he deserves.Now, don't get me wrong-the movie is still bad, technically speaking-but it's self-aware about that. Instead of being ""bad bad,"" it chooses to be ""fun bad"" and entertain you, and I respect that. Not every movie needs to be great; sometimes being fun is enough.Even with the lows, I have always found a weird sense of comfort with this rendition of Venom. I have found myself caring more for these characters than maybe even the script intended. So I am happy to say that by the end, it does enough to justify this trilogy's existence - and to such an satisfying extent that I'd rather live in a world where the Venom movies exist than one where it doesn't.",Positive
729,"The third installment about the symbiotic anti-hero is a mix of bright moments and disappointments. Tom Hardy once again proves why he is the perfect choice for the role of Eddie Brock/Venom, but even his charismatic performance cannot save the unbalanced ensemble. The film starts off promisingly - with dynamic action and witty dialogue between Eddie and his symbiotic companion. Their relationship is still the best the series has to offer. Hardy brilliantly manages both comedic timing and dramatic moments. The visual effects are impressive in places, especially in the action sequences where Venom shows off his abilities. At other times, however, the CGI feels inadequate and more reminiscent of a video game from the last decade. Some fights are well choreographed, others are a chaotic mix of digital effects. The biggest problem is the script, which tries to be too ambitious. It mixes several storylines, introduces new characters and antagonists, but does not give them enough space to develop. The result is a rushed pace and superficial characters. The film's darker tone is a welcome change, but it often clashes with the comedic elements, creating an unbalanced whole. The film seems unsure whether it wants to be a serious drama or a lighthearted entertainment. Venom: The Last Dance is like a roller coaster - it's ups and downs. For fans of the series, it offers enough fun, but it's hard to call it a significant step forward. This film is like an average song on a great album, but as a whole it doesn't leave a strong impression. Fans will find their own, others may be disappointed.",Positive
730,"Maybe it's just because of my low expectations toward the series but it was just fun to watch. I've already lost hope for the trilogy to have a decent plot but I can say that this one has a better storyline than the second film.CGI was fine, I coudn't find any disturbing point. It was interesting to see the other symbiotes. I think those new symbiotes showed more symbiote-ish action scenes than venom when it comes to the fight ironically.There were a few funny jokes that made me laugh but I didn't really find Eddie's weird obsession for shoes funny, like was it supposed to be funny? Guess it was meant to be humor but well... it was almost tiring.",Neutral
731,"A solid enough send off for this 'Venom' trilogy.'Venom: The Last Dance' is decently amusing and produces enough entertainment with its plot. I didn't personally find it overly funny, though the person a few seats across from me had an absolute blast - never a bad thing seeing people enjoy themselves!Tom Hardy remains the key element of these films, they would be far less enjoyable without his presence. There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor stick out most from the other characters.",Negative

733,"Being Rated R probably would have saved this; I am just saying!This trilogy-capper almost makes me question if I have become more of a movie critic than a movie enjoyer. Then I remembered this is Sony's Spider-Man Universe we are talking about, which gave us films like ""Morbius"" and ""Madame Web."" I nonetheless went in here with an open mind, considering I do not mind the two previous ""Venom"" films that came out. After seeing ""The Last Dance,"" I question whether Sony was trying to set up their universe or give Eddie Brock and Venom the send-off they deserve. I am sadly leaning more toward the former.I should preface this review by telling you what I thought of the other two ""Venom"" films upon rewatch in preparation for this third installment. Those were entertaining yet disappointing superhero films saved by the performance of Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and Venom. The first was innocent enough, with a dull first and more engaging second half, a weak villain in Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake/Riot, exciting action, and Hardy performing nicely. Its sequel, ""Let There Be Carnage,"" surprisingly got better when revisiting it, easily surpassing its predecessor, with Hardy allowed to stretch his comedic abilities with Brock and Venom bickering hilariously. In addition, there is Woody Harrelson's enjoyable performance as Cletus Kasady/Carnage, who manages to rise above the flaws, including the disappointing inclusion of Naomie Harris' Frances Barrison/Shriek. Hardy was allowed to have fun with his characters, and the movies complimented him with a narrative that was not too complicated. The opposite is true for ""The Last Dance.""Let's get the positives out of the way first. It is a short list, which I am deeply saddened by, but I want to show you how it is not the worst superhero film out there or even the worst film of the year.Despite a woeful screenplay, Tom Hardy still does skillfully with Eddie Brock and Venom. He is not allowed to have as much fun as he did in the prior two films, but he is trying his best (right, the positives. Sorry).The rest of the cast delivered equally solid performances, with the other standout being Chiwetel Ejiofor as Orwell Taylor. Ejiofor always has a commanding presence whenever he is in a movie, with his characters of Baron Mordo in the two ""Doctor Strange"" films and Bathurst 2020 in the forgettable ""Infinite"" being the two I can think of at the top of my head. Even if the film is not the best, Ejiofor makes it work, and if it is fantastic, he always steals the show.The visual effects bring Venom and the other alien characters to gorgeous life. The other two ""Venom"" movies, granted, had remarkable CGI, but it is worth mentioning, specifically when discussing the positives.The action is somewhat fun. The ""Venom"" movies have always had enjoyable action. Unfortunately, ""The Last Dance"" was the least fun action-wise, but the first scene with action was sweet.The Venom symbiote is sometimes uniquely utilized. The trailers showcased Venom controlling a horse, and in the film, it is one of its best scenes. I am unsure if this is a spoiler, but he controls other animals, and they introduce other symbiotes, which is fun.I think that is it for the positives.I felt the portrayal of Eddie Brock and Venom this time was not good. Again, Hardy tried, but there were multiple times when it felt like he was bored. His character was, admittedly, bored at intervals, and Hardy is a screenwriter, but I am saying how it felt.The film tries to add new characters, but they are not compelling. The most obvious example is Dr. Payne, played by Juno Temple, who does nothing aside from believing that Brock is not a danger, while Ejiofor wants what is best for the world, considering the alien threat from Knull.Speaking of Knull, he was worse than Carlton Drake. He only sends alien minions to grab a MacGuffin that Venom has. I have not read the comics, but the impression I get from others and this movie is that Knull has a profound lore not represented here. Having Knull's alien pals and the Area 51 agents as the villains is too much, yet somehow too little.They also wasted Stephen Graham's Detective Mulligan. The trailers made it seem like Mulligan would be a principal and intriguing character. The only two interesting aspects about Mulligan are he has a symbiote and warns of Knull. That is it.Furthermore, it does not have that much comedy. ""Let There Be Carnage"" can easily be classified as a comedy, and I laughed more than I would like to admit. I think two laughs and three to five chuckles were all I had here. The film was not funny outside of the Venom horse and some banter between Brock and Venom.On top of that, there was not that much emotion. It is due to how much Brock and Venom were not well utilized and the clutter of characters. I did not care about the Area 51 personnel nor the unnamed family who brought Brock and Venom to Vegas. When the ending came along, which heightened the stakes to an unbelievable degree, I did not get emotional. It tried, but it failed to work.The other two ""Venom"" movies were entertaining, but this failed to come close. In an era where ""superhero fatigue"" is becoming more accepted, this trilogy-closer did not try anything new. Fascinating concepts here and there, and many standout scenes fail to save this disappointment in a franchise filled with them.Technically, a 6/10. Outside of the plot and the underwhelming screenplay, the visual effects remain exceptional, the actors did great, and the film functions.For the enjoyment score, I wanted to like this film. I had the sneaking suspicion that it might not work, but watching ""Let There Be Carnage"" increase in quality gave me hope. It was no ""Let There Be Carnage"" and is easily the weakest of the trilogy. It had the issues that plagued the likes of ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but does not come close to being as entertaining as them. I am so unhappy that the enjoyment score is a 4/10, but this trilogy deserved a better conclusion. Maybe it will get better when I watch it again, but as it stands, it is best for me to recommend you wait until Netflix or even Disney+.",Positive
734,"This movie was very middle of the road to me. Definitely better than the second one, but not as good as the original.I enjoyed the beginning very much. Nice pace, good story and funny at times. Also the last part was packed with action and it all looked amazing. Only thing I missed was some sort of a climax at the very end.The middle however, I did not care for too much. Some things felt forced, rushed and very unlikely. But as I often say in my reviews: 'It is a fictional, fantasy, action movie so who cares if some things do not add up.'As a whole I enjoyed it very much, Tom Hardy did not disappoint.",Positive
735,"I just don't get it, I thought the 1st Venom was good despite many fans may not have liked it. I'm not a comic fan, so for me it was good that they try to make it as relatable and realistic to just your average movie goer.The 2nd film was cringy and terrible in my opinion because the story didn't make much sense, too much drama, poetry, and bromance. I lost interest after watching that one but the trailer for this film looked good.Right from the beginning I realize this was going to be bad. I don't care about the multi-verse, I don't care about Knull, I don't care about all these comic lores. The story is completely unrelatable and the suspension of disbelief failed early on.And then to top it off, the ending was just awful.4/10 for the special effects. Everything else is a 0.",Negative
736,"If you've already come to terms with this version of Venom and Eddie Brock as more of a bromance than the savage, brutal duo from the comics, you're in for a fun ride, Venom: The Last Dance, the final chapter of the trilogy, delivers an entertaining ride with solid pacing, good performances, decent visual effects, and fun engaging enough story, added also with the joy of let all the madness fan service out makes Venom: The Last Dance an easy good time especially for me, even the serious part mostly with Chiwetel Ejiofor was executed pretty well, surprising wholesome moments with Rhys Ifans and his family characters, flawed? Sure, some of the editing cuts didn't quite work for me, there were a few cheesy, awkward moments that felt off, and nit picky here and there, overall, i have a good time with Venom: The Last Dance, and the most surprising thing also the least thing i could expect watching this supposed to be last time we'll see both Venom and Eddie was that i did get quite emotional at the end, it's clear they've evolved from mere host and symbiote to something much deeper, and their dynamic was surprisingly touching, my personal experience with these two also comes as long as these three movies together, and as the movie itself whether it's better than the first one which also a good movie in my opinion, The Last Dance succeeded my expectation from being far from bad, i want this goodbye to be at least watchable enough, and the result is more than that, Venom: The Last Dance is actually a good film, just like Venom would say, We are Venom, and this film makes sure we feel it.",Negative
737,"Fun, wild, and hot mess. There's too much plot that's never explained. Events just happen randomly with no payoff, with a big action scene towards the end. Eddie & Venom Bromance is the savior of this trilogy. If you enjoy the others you will enjoy this.Synopsis:
In Venom: The Last Dance, Tom Hardy returns as Venom, one of Marvel's greatest and most complex characters, for the final film in the trilogy. Eddie and Venom are on the run. Hunted by both of their worlds and with the net closing in, the duo are forced into a devastating decision that will bring the curtains down on Venom and Eddie's last dance.",Positive
738,"If you were hoping for a grand finale to the Venom franchise that would surpass the comedic heights of its predecessors, you're in for a letdown. While Venom: The Last Dance does deliver on the comedic front, it falls short in nearly every other aspect.The film picks up right where we left off, with Eddie Brock and Venom still on the run. The plot takes a convoluted turn as they become embroiled in a government conspiracy involving symbiotes and a dangerous threat to the universe. While the premise is intriguing, the execution feels rushed and often confusing.The real draw of this film, as with its predecessors, is the chemistry between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom. Their banter and witty exchanges provide much-needed humor and keep the film entertaining. However, the comedic elements can feel forced at times, and the overall tone can be uneven.The film's biggest flaw is its reliance on poor CGI and even worse dialogue. The visual effects, particularly those involving the titular symbiote, often feel like a step back from previous entries. Venom's appearances are fleeting, and when he does appear in full form, he's often overshadowed by lackluster animation.The script is equally disappointing. The story lacks depth and originality, and the characters feel one-dimensional. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the pacing feels uneven. While there are a few moments of humor that might elicit a chuckle, they're not enough to salvage the film.Ultimately, Venom: The Last Dance is a missed opportunity. It's a shame that such a potentially fun franchise has ended on such a sour note.",Negative
739,"If cinematic catastrophes could have a mascot, this would be standing at the front of the line, waving its tattered flag of mediocrity. Tom Hardy's final outing as Eddie Brock/Venom is not just a disappointment-it's an insult to audiences everywhere. To call this movie bad would be a kindness. This is an incoherent, muddled, and utterly joyless mess that somehow manages to fall short of even the lowest expectations.The premise of Eddie and Venom being ""on the run"" from both worlds promised at least some thrilling action. Instead, what we get is a chaotic, poorly-scripted nightmare of disjointed scenes and absurd plot holes big enough to swallow the entire Marvel universe. The narrative, if you can call it that, lurches forward with all the grace of a drunken man stumbling in the dark. There is no rhyme or reason to the events that unfold. It's like the writers cobbled together every half-baked idea they could think of and hoped nobody would notice how little sense any of it makes.The so-called ""devastating decision"" that Eddie and Venom face feels less like a culmination of their journey and more like a cheap, hollow ploy to yank on the audience's emotions. But even that attempt falls flat because, by the time it arrives, the viewer is too exhausted from enduring 90 minutes of mindless drivel to care.Eddie Brock, once a complex and conflicted anti-hero from the source comics, is reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self, mumbling and stumbling through the film like he just wants to get it over with.The supporting characters are even worse-if that's possible. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use cardboard cutouts of side characters nobody cares about and clearly has no understanding of what made the earlier films (barely) work.They serve no purpose other than to waste screen time and remind us that, yes, someone actually wrote this drivel down on paper.It wouldn't be a Venom movie without over-the-top CGI battles, right? Well, unfortunately, the action scenes here are so poorly executed and short to save cost that even those who came purely for mindless entertainment will leave disappointed. The special effects are a headache-inducing blur of dark, indistinguishable shapes smashing into each other, with zero sense of tension or creativity.The final fight scene feels like -an unintelligible swirl of chaos that is supposed to distract us from the fact that nothing of consequence is happening. It's not exciting, it's not entertaining, it's just ugly.At its core it tries to sell itself as a dramatic, emotional farewell to Eddie and Venom's bond, but it doesn't even come close to achieving that. Any attempt at emotional weight is drowned by the film's clumsy pacing and complete lack of character development. The so-called ""devastating"" decision feels unearned, forced, and utterly unconvincing. There is no sense of closure, no satisfying payoff-just a hollow, empty finale that leaves you wondering why you wasted your time in the first place.Avoid this movie like the symbiote plague it is. Eddie and Venom deserved better. We all deserved better.Tom's ego and nepotism to promote his FWB director both of whom had sole credit of writing the script should tell you that how much he actually despises the franchise.Tom was the ultimate culprit is giving the first movie it's comic tone and had heated arguments with Ruben Flesicher on set to such an extent that filming halted for a few days. There were 3 script writers on the first movie can you guess who was one of them?It's the director of this movie who with her relationship strong armed and hijacked the plot elements and forced to introduce the comic tone into the first movie by reshooting the movie which had resulted in a disjointed mess.Even the Ruben had expressed his deep regrets about that but I guess if you can control the leading star you can have your way.If you closely look at the tone of the first movie first trailer you will notice the horror and science fiction elements present which had been stripped down to barebones and gag and quips reigned supreme.",Negative
740,"My wife and I watched Venom: The Last Dance (2024) last night in theaters. The storyline follows Eddie Brock, who is on the run from the law and hiding in Mexico. When an invasion from Venom's home world begins, Eddie must make his way to Area 51 to find reinforcements and fight off the invaders.Directed by Kelly Marcel in her directorial debut, the film stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Rhys Ifans (The Amazing Spider-Man), Stephen Graham (Snatch), and Juno Temple (Killer Joe).I absolutely loved the first two-thirds of this film. Tom Hardy nailed his role, bringing a perfect blend of humor, action, and Venom's signature appetite for chaos. The various forms Venom takes are visually entertaining, and the self-deprecating humor is spot-on. We especially enjoyed the introduction of a quirky ""hippie family,"" who added a fun twist. However, once the story shifts to Area 51, things feel rushed and forced. The other symbiotes look incredible, but they come and go so quickly that you're left wanting more. The villain's defeat also felt underwhelming, and I wanted a bit more depth in their storyline. The homage at the end felt somewhat awkward as well.In conclusion, Venom: The Last Dance is a fun watch and definitely worth seeing for fans of the character, though it doesn't quite reach its full potential. I'd rate it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Positive

742,"Venom 3 is fun movie. It will never be critically rated, but it doesn't need or try to be. It is fun, it is weird, it looks good and the interactions between Eddie and Venom are great as always and are funny unlike the forced jokes that don't always land. We get to see a bit more of the rest of the symbiotes, but it is not a major focus of the movie to introduce or highlight them, which was a bit disappointing personally. The storyline is a bit messy, and there are a few plotholes and illogical, unexplainable events, but the movie does a good job of actually taking the viewers through it. We get and ending to the trilogy that is pretty much what you expect, but the emotional charge of it feels a bit forced and doesn't let the viewer appreciate it for themselves. We also get a glimpse of what may come in the future, including a namedrop that comic fans will get, so we may see more of our goofy antihero in the future.",Positive
743,"Venom The Last Dance was hilarious, emotional and entertaining. Went in with the same expectations as before very low. I'm shocked about the critics, cause they expected much more unreal scenarios. Here again Sony is not stupid of course they'd have added a specific character in their world, but they probably can't because of a certain contract clause. The third movie is much better than the second cause the second movie suffered from extreme cuts which took out all its potential. Despite the fact that Venom was rumored and in productions ever since early 00s it's no wonder they made a trilogy and had box office success, cause Tom Hardy carried those movies on his own. Every other actor wouldn't be able to pull out this great chemistry between him and Venom. I'm not biased I see its flaws and weaknesses, but my God some critics thrashed this movie as if it's another Morbius or Madame Web. It's by far a better movie.The road trip family was adorable not necessary but there to add a more family atmosphere and emotional touch to this film. Juno Temple was good but underperformed and here background story was dragged into this movie.Ms Cheng was probably the best positive highlight of the movie besides the love for dogs and animals in general.A lot of great symbionts and designs were actually great to watch. I can't say much more to that point cause I want to avoid spoilers.The issuesThe plot and goal of the movie is clear but gets lost through the movie. The action sequences and CGI were average at best. I know that sounds awful for a higher rating, but hear me out. The cast was decent and some actors really shined here.Another problem is the camera work here too many fast cuts hardly to see specially when I think I was obligated to watch it in 3D. I prefer 2D.The biggest problem was there is no clear 1 v 1 villain here with heart and intentions. We have Knull as the big bad in the background but barely seen but only to bait us fans to watch it and another mystery character from the army or swat like crew not shown at all. Where as the first two movies had clear antagonists shown.Issue / or averageThe Ending was emotional and impactful with rushed bangs, but man there were some scenes I really felt touched by it. I still think they could've done more and Tom deserved more !I give it 6 but as a trilogy part and the Tom Hardy factor a light 7, cause reviews between 1-4 stars are harsh. And yeah don't leave there are two important post credit scenes. I'm really looking forward !",Positive

745,"Barely emotional. Barely funny. Barely mediocre. From this pattern, it can be deducted that Venom: The Last Dance is a passable movie that doesn't do enough right to feel like an epic send off, or do anything inherently wrong to be worth complaining about. It's just fine.Tom Hardy is once again the easy stand-out as Eddie Brock, using the same janky physical actions as Venom manipulates his movements to an entertaining degree. The humour is the same safe but fine lines of dialogue that either evoke a chuckle or short exhale of breath. The action scenes escalate in levels of excitement throughout the film, with the final act especially delivering some really fun mayhem. And being the supposed final film of the trilogy, there are some surprisingly tender moments sprinkled in, but aren't frequent enough to draw any real emotion.As aforementioned, the humour is fine but there's one particular segment of the film in Las Vegas that feels too ridiculous and reckless in the context of the movie. Moreover, the story sets up rules that either get contradicted, forgotten, or straight up ignored for the sake of 'cool' scenes. Aside from Eddie and Venom, the rest of the cast of characters come off as either underutilised, underdeveloped, or unnecessary. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rhys Ifans feel criminally wasted, Juno Temple and Clark Backo undermine each other as their characters could've been just compiled into one due to their similar traits, and Stephen Graham and Peggy Lu don't do much to feel properly utilised, especially Graham, who's character felt like was building up to a bigger pay-off than what we got. And the antagonist Knull was so sidelined that there's not much more to say about him other than 'he was in the movie'.In conclusion, for what Venom: The Last Dance can't deliver in a concise plot or compelling side characters, it manages to make up for it with fun symbiote action and mostly entertaining and semi-heartfelt sequences.",Negative
746,"Sony should publicly apologise to the audience for making this worst movie and make the audience suffer and wasted their time. So boring story, nothing to appreciate only actor (Tom Hardy) has done, good acting Else, everyone, not done anything to discuss, that's why am giving one star.Don't waste your money by going into the theatres. CGI was good, but story was so pathetic. You can just guess the whole picture by trailer waste of money. Tom Hardy should try superhero movies with other Studios sony is not good with superheroes. We have already seen this with Superman. Middle part was so boring and ending was too predictable.",Negative
747,"Venom: The Last Dance delivers exactly what it promises-an absurdly fun, high-octane ride with a surprising amount of heart. If you expected Avengers: Endgame level of finality, you walked into the wrong theater, but for those who wanted a dumb but entertaining alien-human bromance, this one's for you.This film is easily the best in the trilogy, blending sharp pacing, humor that actually lands, and action sequences that never feel forced. The weird yet charming dynamic between Eddie and Venom is in full swing, and the filmmakers know exactly how to tap into the ridiculous yet endearing relationship that has become the backbone of this series. It's self-aware without feeling desperate for laughs, striking a balance that's tough to nail in superhero movies these days.While some of the gore pushes the limits of PG-13, it's never gratuitous. There's enough bite to the violence to keep you hooked, but it stops short of being overwhelming. If anything, it adds a little edge to an otherwise slick, polished blockbuster.But the real kicker here is that, amidst all the chaos, Venom: The Last Dance sneaks in some genuine emotion. It's a film about keeping your best bro close, and somehow that works. So why all the hate? It's a popcorn flick that knows exactly what it is, and honestly, that's rare these days.",Positive
748,Almost the whole cast was full. The only cast members that helped was the family and of course the store lady. Mulligan was boring . I felt there was a power struggle when writing this. One wanted to show ase strong women yet made them look stupied and to emotional; while the other smart men but utterly useless in the long run causing more havoc and not thinking before moving.The CGI are as ok. The one creatures could have been way way more creative for sure.Over all it's a lack luster film unfortunately 😕..there's so much they could have done with Tom and this story line. We needed a version of him and Spider man yet have been robbed of that.,Negative
749,"First and foremost, it felt like the makers made every poor decision possible when it came to the sound tracks and music. That which is supposed to amplify the intensity of ride simply let it remain bland throughout, even the climax, even the falling action.With Venom and Eddie having largely ceased their bickering, their bromance has dwindled significantly in this movie. Being the conclusional piece of this hilarious trilogy, it has fallen short of many expectations.Of course there was some of those promised action as witnessed in the trailers. But was there something which swept me off my feet which was absent from the trailers? Not really.While the villain's back-story is rather solid, it could have been more centre-stage. Most of the characters that have made appearance in this movie felt weakly woven together; though the plot could not have moved forward without their roles, they barely left any impact. Speaking of the plot, it largely remains uneventful, with the makers just throwing a few name-sake 3D effect villainous creatures at our faces. There is only one major action sequence throughout the film, that it low-key has bottled down to something I would either skim through, or watch at a slightly increased playback speed.If the unnecessary scenes, and by that I mean, 'adding no humor or value to the plot' scenes were deleted, it could easily boil down to half its current run-time. That being said, there could definitely be leads from where this movie has left loose ends at, but presently, it stays far aloof from being involved in such a gifting.I feel like the last of the trilogy has not done justice to the previous two movies, it almost feels like watching a different character. The ending in particular came off to me as a tryhard terrific ending, and even if the clips were good, the track choices really did not work out for me.",Negative
750,"Eddie and Venom are on the run as fugitives after their battle with Carnage. They are chased by military force and aliens that want to capture them for their codex to unleash a greater evil in their world. Eddie and Venom venture out for a while avoiding authorities and the alien species.I am a fan of the first Venom movie. It is not a well-made movie, but it is so entertaining because of Tom Hardy's crazy performance in both roles and the wacky humor throughout the film. The second movie is much better made mainly because of Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris, but I actually enjoyed the first one more on a fun level. I was pretty excited for the third film and the trailers had me hooked. Does this trilogy end on a memorable last dance?I have mixed thoughts on Venom: The Last Dance. Let's start with the good. I love Eddie and Venom's dynamic and they are at their best in this movie. They have fun chemistry and banter and it feels like they are finally starting to get along with each other a bit better. They also have a few emotional moments that can come off as cheesy, but they have charm especially one scene where Eddie reassures Martin's son that his alien friend is there to help and Venom thanks the kid for a piece of chocolate. In a movie filled with silly moments and action-packed battles, it is a really sweet moment that shows how heroic Eddie and Venom have become.It helps that Tom Hardy is an absolute joy to watch. Hardy relishes in both of his roles and he never lets up. There are several moments of him doing stuff like going crazy at the slot machine and creating a drink at the bar by himself in a quick way. He also handles the more dramatic scenes very well making the more emotional moments work better than they should have.Also, Venom is a very cool character here. He is funny, his powers are awesome and he does anything to protect Eddie even knowing that if they are both alive the aliens will track them down because they have a codex. Venom's antics are very endearing and it seems like he just wants to join the fun and even tries to get Eddie to join in. I love watching him take control of other animals such as a horse, a fish and a frog. Venom is so much fun to watch and he is a good reason why I enjoy these movies despite their faults.The humor is for the most part pretty good. There is one gag that I cringed at but other than that, I got several laughs out of this movie. The banter between Eddie and Venom never gets old for me.The action scenes are pretty entertaining. The chase scene in the river is a standout because it looks cool, it has Eddie Brock defend himself without Venom and Venom turning into other creatures. It is also frenetic and fun to see play out. The climax is also big full of cool moments, but it is a little CGI heavy. However, it features Venom on a motorcycle again and it looks great. Overall, I enjoyed the action.The cinematography by Fabian Wagner is solid and colorful. The lighting is also on point with all of the scenes being lit well enough to see while having some flare in the shots. This is by far the best looking Venom movie filmmaking wise. The special effects are more polished and the alien creatures chasing Venom and Eddie look very menacing. Honestly, they kind of remind me of the Kaijus from Pacific Rim and I like that. There also other symbiotes in the film and they look very cool with their designs, but some of their colors blend in. The visuals are not perfect, but they are an upgrade from the last two movies.All that said, there are a few problems I have with this movie. The biggest problem is that the script is overstuffed. I know that there needs to other plot lines to have the story come together, but some of them do not work at all. The scientists subplot is one of the most boring parts of the movie with how slowly paced it is and how the tone shifts from fun to dreary and not the good kind of dreary. The subplot with Martin and his family is okay and has some great moments, but it can drag a little too long.The supporting cast does not hold a candle to Tom Hardy. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Rex Strickland is the best supporting performance, but his character is too unlikable to root for. Dr. Payne is kind of there until the climax. Clark Backo as Sadie Christmas is alright and she does a lot in the climax, but her character does not stand out until then. Rhys Ifans is having a lot of fun in his role as a family man who believes in aliens. While his family may have gotten a little more focus than they should have, Ifans is pretty fun to watch at times. Andy Serkis as Knull is absolutely wasted. He seems like a menacing villain, but he gets little to do aside from getting expository dialogue. By far, the weakest link in the film and wastes Andy Serkis on a limited role.The tone is all over the place. There are moments where this movie acts like a cheesy road trip comedy with Eddie and Venom and then the next scene could be overly serious research about the symbiotes. The movie progressively darker as it goes along and it has some moments that should come off as emotional and while they kind of work because of Tom Hardy's performance and the duo's likability, they feel a bit unearned because of how comedic this series is by now. When Eddie and Venom ponder the life they could have had when in the car with Martin's family, it is hard to feel anything because they have been two goofballs most of the time. Without spoiling anything, ending is a mixed bag for me because it is sad, but not a tearjerker like the movie wants it to be.The musical score by Dan Deacon makes no impression on me. It just sounds like generic music from any other movie. The needle drops are okay, but I wish they could find another song than Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. However, the credits song One Last Dance by Tom and Roman Morello and Grandson is really catchy and a great song to end the movie. Also, Maroon 5's Memories has a great needle drop here.Venom: The Last Dance is an entertaining movie. It is not well-made and not even as fun as the first film, but I overall had a pretty good time with the movie despite the many issues it has. I guess I cannot help but find Eddie and Venom a lot of fun to watch. Director Kelly Marcel did a great job with the scenes with those two and with the action scenes, but I think she bit off more than she could chew with the other subplots. If you like the Venom movies, you will probably enjoy this movie but if you never them then this movie will not change your mind.Stay through all of the credits.",Positive
751,"It is genuinely impressive that Sony managed to make the most mediocre trilogy ever with such an iconic character.In terms of enjoyment, Eddie and Venom continue to be a delightfully fun duo. In this 3rd movie, they are basically on a road trip and that was relatively entertaining for the most part. The final act of the movie was also a pretty enjoyable CGI action fest with some emotional scenes.However, the story and script are still as flat as ever. The narrative feels very half baked with it feeling like a chain of things just randomly happening. Pointless characters that don't add much. Jokes being thrown at you just to see which land. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor characters could have been played by anyone but feels purposely done because they knew fans recognised them from other Marvel projects. The villain Knull looks cool but is just there to be teased for future projects.Overall, it is better than the second film but just on par with the first. It is a mediocre final entry. Sony continues to disappoint with their universe and We all know Venom is coming back somehow. I do worry for Spiderman 4 and hope Sony don't mess that movie in anyway.",Neutral
752,"""Venom: The Last Dance' is a messy buddy road trip in which you must turn your brains off...again.Is it perfect? Nah, far from it. I think there are way too many storylines in here, and the main one got some potential, but it was wasted in typical Sony fashion. The ""Spider-Man 4"" rumors have been blown out of proportion in my opinion, so temper your expectations.The duo between Eddie and Venom is as fun as always. I mean Tom Hardy and the banter between them...I'm sorry, the banter between Hardy and himself is the best part of these movies (Hardy is doing the voice of Venom).The humor is there, but can't say I laughed all that much, beacause most of the jokes are base level childish again. It must be a bit more emotional as a whole, because supposedly is the last time we see Venom (hardly doubt), but it ends up kinda hollow.Knull is there...I guess, but will see how and when they'll use him again...it's Sony after all.It's a popcorn movie that reminds me of the early 2000's comic book movies. The action in the third act is good for the most parts and there are some funny moments here and there. Are there plot holes and some issues with the story? Yes. It's just another ""Turn your brains off"" Sony movie again.There are two credit scenes, first one is kinda important, the second one not so much.",Positive
753,"My relationship with the Venom franchise has been rocky. I have a soft spot for the first one, absolutely loathe the second, and now we come to the trilogy's closer, and thankfully, it's an improvement.Venom: The Last Dance works best when it focuses on Eddie and Venom's story instead of trying to set up the future of the Sonyverse. If you didn't like the previous Venom films, this won't change your mind. It's still messy, but it gets more right than its predecessors.This is easily the campiest and most mature of the bunch. It takes its time with the characters, letting us sit with them instead of rushing into the next action set piece. Still being PG-13 it manages to cram in a lot more gore than its predecessors. The action is inventive, and the humor hits its mark. It also doesn't shy away from getting personal and emotional. Eddie and Venom's relationship has never felt more genuine. I'll admit-I teared up a few times by the end.Some may be disappointed by the potrayal of Knull, but personally, I loved it. He feels like an overlooming threat rather than an one-off villain, and the ""God of Darkness"" gets a Thanos-esque treatment he deserves.Now, don't get me wrong-the movie is still bad, technically speaking-but it's self-aware about that. Instead of being ""bad bad,"" it chooses to be ""fun bad"" and entertain you, and I respect that. Not every movie needs to be great; sometimes being fun is enough.Even with the lows, I have always found a weird sense of comfort with this rendition of Venom. I have found myself caring more for these characters than maybe even the script intended. So I am happy to say that by the end, it does enough to justify this trilogy's existence - and to such an satisfying extent that I'd rather live in a world where the Venom movies exist than one where it doesn't.",Positive
754,"The third installment about the symbiotic anti-hero is a mix of bright moments and disappointments. Tom Hardy once again proves why he is the perfect choice for the role of Eddie Brock/Venom, but even his charismatic performance cannot save the unbalanced ensemble. The film starts off promisingly - with dynamic action and witty dialogue between Eddie and his symbiotic companion. Their relationship is still the best the series has to offer. Hardy brilliantly manages both comedic timing and dramatic moments. The visual effects are impressive in places, especially in the action sequences where Venom shows off his abilities. At other times, however, the CGI feels inadequate and more reminiscent of a video game from the last decade. Some fights are well choreographed, others are a chaotic mix of digital effects. The biggest problem is the script, which tries to be too ambitious. It mixes several storylines, introduces new characters and antagonists, but does not give them enough space to develop. The result is a rushed pace and superficial characters. The film's darker tone is a welcome change, but it often clashes with the comedic elements, creating an unbalanced whole. The film seems unsure whether it wants to be a serious drama or a lighthearted entertainment. Venom: The Last Dance is like a roller coaster - it's ups and downs. For fans of the series, it offers enough fun, but it's hard to call it a significant step forward. This film is like an average song on a great album, but as a whole it doesn't leave a strong impression. Fans will find their own, others may be disappointed.",Positive
755,"Maybe it's just because of my low expectations toward the series but it was just fun to watch. I've already lost hope for the trilogy to have a decent plot but I can say that this one has a better storyline than the second film.CGI was fine, I coudn't find any disturbing point. It was interesting to see the other symbiotes. I think those new symbiotes showed more symbiote-ish action scenes than venom when it comes to the fight ironically.There were a few funny jokes that made me laugh but I didn't really find Eddie's weird obsession for shoes funny, like was it supposed to be funny? Guess it was meant to be humor but well... it was almost tiring.",Neutral
756,"A solid enough send off for this 'Venom' trilogy.'Venom: The Last Dance' is decently amusing and produces enough entertainment with its plot. I didn't personally find it overly funny, though the person a few seats across from me had an absolute blast - never a bad thing seeing people enjoy themselves!Tom Hardy remains the key element of these films, they would be far less enjoyable without his presence. There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor stick out most from the other characters.",Negative

758,"Being Rated R probably would have saved this; I am just saying!This trilogy-capper almost makes me question if I have become more of a movie critic than a movie enjoyer. Then I remembered this is Sony's Spider-Man Universe we are talking about, which gave us films like ""Morbius"" and ""Madame Web."" I nonetheless went in here with an open mind, considering I do not mind the two previous ""Venom"" films that came out. After seeing ""The Last Dance,"" I question whether Sony was trying to set up their universe or give Eddie Brock and Venom the send-off they deserve. I am sadly leaning more toward the former.I should preface this review by telling you what I thought of the other two ""Venom"" films upon rewatch in preparation for this third installment. Those were entertaining yet disappointing superhero films saved by the performance of Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and Venom. The first was innocent enough, with a dull first and more engaging second half, a weak villain in Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake/Riot, exciting action, and Hardy performing nicely. Its sequel, ""Let There Be Carnage,"" surprisingly got better when revisiting it, easily surpassing its predecessor, with Hardy allowed to stretch his comedic abilities with Brock and Venom bickering hilariously. In addition, there is Woody Harrelson's enjoyable performance as Cletus Kasady/Carnage, who manages to rise above the flaws, including the disappointing inclusion of Naomie Harris' Frances Barrison/Shriek. Hardy was allowed to have fun with his characters, and the movies complimented him with a narrative that was not too complicated. The opposite is true for ""The Last Dance.""Let's get the positives out of the way first. It is a short list, which I am deeply saddened by, but I want to show you how it is not the worst superhero film out there or even the worst film of the year.Despite a woeful screenplay, Tom Hardy still does skillfully with Eddie Brock and Venom. He is not allowed to have as much fun as he did in the prior two films, but he is trying his best (right, the positives. Sorry).The rest of the cast delivered equally solid performances, with the other standout being Chiwetel Ejiofor as Orwell Taylor. Ejiofor always has a commanding presence whenever he is in a movie, with his characters of Baron Mordo in the two ""Doctor Strange"" films and Bathurst 2020 in the forgettable ""Infinite"" being the two I can think of at the top of my head. Even if the film is not the best, Ejiofor makes it work, and if it is fantastic, he always steals the show.The visual effects bring Venom and the other alien characters to gorgeous life. The other two ""Venom"" movies, granted, had remarkable CGI, but it is worth mentioning, specifically when discussing the positives.The action is somewhat fun. The ""Venom"" movies have always had enjoyable action. Unfortunately, ""The Last Dance"" was the least fun action-wise, but the first scene with action was sweet.The Venom symbiote is sometimes uniquely utilized. The trailers showcased Venom controlling a horse, and in the film, it is one of its best scenes. I am unsure if this is a spoiler, but he controls other animals, and they introduce other symbiotes, which is fun.I think that is it for the positives.I felt the portrayal of Eddie Brock and Venom this time was not good. Again, Hardy tried, but there were multiple times when it felt like he was bored. His character was, admittedly, bored at intervals, and Hardy is a screenwriter, but I am saying how it felt.The film tries to add new characters, but they are not compelling. The most obvious example is Dr. Payne, played by Juno Temple, who does nothing aside from believing that Brock is not a danger, while Ejiofor wants what is best for the world, considering the alien threat from Knull.Speaking of Knull, he was worse than Carlton Drake. He only sends alien minions to grab a MacGuffin that Venom has. I have not read the comics, but the impression I get from others and this movie is that Knull has a profound lore not represented here. Having Knull's alien pals and the Area 51 agents as the villains is too much, yet somehow too little.They also wasted Stephen Graham's Detective Mulligan. The trailers made it seem like Mulligan would be a principal and intriguing character. The only two interesting aspects about Mulligan are he has a symbiote and warns of Knull. That is it.Furthermore, it does not have that much comedy. ""Let There Be Carnage"" can easily be classified as a comedy, and I laughed more than I would like to admit. I think two laughs and three to five chuckles were all I had here. The film was not funny outside of the Venom horse and some banter between Brock and Venom.On top of that, there was not that much emotion. It is due to how much Brock and Venom were not well utilized and the clutter of characters. I did not care about the Area 51 personnel nor the unnamed family who brought Brock and Venom to Vegas. When the ending came along, which heightened the stakes to an unbelievable degree, I did not get emotional. It tried, but it failed to work.The other two ""Venom"" movies were entertaining, but this failed to come close. In an era where ""superhero fatigue"" is becoming more accepted, this trilogy-closer did not try anything new. Fascinating concepts here and there, and many standout scenes fail to save this disappointment in a franchise filled with them.Technically, a 6/10. Outside of the plot and the underwhelming screenplay, the visual effects remain exceptional, the actors did great, and the film functions.For the enjoyment score, I wanted to like this film. I had the sneaking suspicion that it might not work, but watching ""Let There Be Carnage"" increase in quality gave me hope. It was no ""Let There Be Carnage"" and is easily the weakest of the trilogy. It had the issues that plagued the likes of ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but does not come close to being as entertaining as them. I am so unhappy that the enjoyment score is a 4/10, but this trilogy deserved a better conclusion. Maybe it will get better when I watch it again, but as it stands, it is best for me to recommend you wait until Netflix or even Disney+.",Positive
759,"This movie was very middle of the road to me. Definitely better than the second one, but not as good as the original.I enjoyed the beginning very much. Nice pace, good story and funny at times. Also the last part was packed with action and it all looked amazing. Only thing I missed was some sort of a climax at the very end.The middle however, I did not care for too much. Some things felt forced, rushed and very unlikely. But as I often say in my reviews: 'It is a fictional, fantasy, action movie so who cares if some things do not add up.'As a whole I enjoyed it very much, Tom Hardy did not disappoint.",Positive
760,"I just don't get it, I thought the 1st Venom was good despite many fans may not have liked it. I'm not a comic fan, so for me it was good that they try to make it as relatable and realistic to just your average movie goer.The 2nd film was cringy and terrible in my opinion because the story didn't make much sense, too much drama, poetry, and bromance. I lost interest after watching that one but the trailer for this film looked good.Right from the beginning I realize this was going to be bad. I don't care about the multi-verse, I don't care about Knull, I don't care about all these comic lores. The story is completely unrelatable and the suspension of disbelief failed early on.And then to top it off, the ending was just awful.4/10 for the special effects. Everything else is a 0.",Negative
761,"If you've already come to terms with this version of Venom and Eddie Brock as more of a bromance than the savage, brutal duo from the comics, you're in for a fun ride, Venom: The Last Dance, the final chapter of the trilogy, delivers an entertaining ride with solid pacing, good performances, decent visual effects, and fun engaging enough story, added also with the joy of let all the madness fan service out makes Venom: The Last Dance an easy good time especially for me, even the serious part mostly with Chiwetel Ejiofor was executed pretty well, surprising wholesome moments with Rhys Ifans and his family characters, flawed? Sure, some of the editing cuts didn't quite work for me, there were a few cheesy, awkward moments that felt off, and nit picky here and there, overall, i have a good time with Venom: The Last Dance, and the most surprising thing also the least thing i could expect watching this supposed to be last time we'll see both Venom and Eddie was that i did get quite emotional at the end, it's clear they've evolved from mere host and symbiote to something much deeper, and their dynamic was surprisingly touching, my personal experience with these two also comes as long as these three movies together, and as the movie itself whether it's better than the first one which also a good movie in my opinion, The Last Dance succeeded my expectation from being far from bad, i want this goodbye to be at least watchable enough, and the result is more than that, Venom: The Last Dance is actually a good film, just like Venom would say, We are Venom, and this film makes sure we feel it.",Negative
762,"Fun, wild, and hot mess. There's too much plot that's never explained. Events just happen randomly with no payoff, with a big action scene towards the end. Eddie & Venom Bromance is the savior of this trilogy. If you enjoy the others you will enjoy this.Synopsis:
In Venom: The Last Dance, Tom Hardy returns as Venom, one of Marvel's greatest and most complex characters, for the final film in the trilogy. Eddie and Venom are on the run. Hunted by both of their worlds and with the net closing in, the duo are forced into a devastating decision that will bring the curtains down on Venom and Eddie's last dance.",Positive
763,"If you were hoping for a grand finale to the Venom franchise that would surpass the comedic heights of its predecessors, you're in for a letdown. While Venom: The Last Dance does deliver on the comedic front, it falls short in nearly every other aspect.The film picks up right where we left off, with Eddie Brock and Venom still on the run. The plot takes a convoluted turn as they become embroiled in a government conspiracy involving symbiotes and a dangerous threat to the universe. While the premise is intriguing, the execution feels rushed and often confusing.The real draw of this film, as with its predecessors, is the chemistry between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom. Their banter and witty exchanges provide much-needed humor and keep the film entertaining. However, the comedic elements can feel forced at times, and the overall tone can be uneven.The film's biggest flaw is its reliance on poor CGI and even worse dialogue. The visual effects, particularly those involving the titular symbiote, often feel like a step back from previous entries. Venom's appearances are fleeting, and when he does appear in full form, he's often overshadowed by lackluster animation.The script is equally disappointing. The story lacks depth and originality, and the characters feel one-dimensional. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the pacing feels uneven. While there are a few moments of humor that might elicit a chuckle, they're not enough to salvage the film.Ultimately, Venom: The Last Dance is a missed opportunity. It's a shame that such a potentially fun franchise has ended on such a sour note.",Negative
764,"If cinematic catastrophes could have a mascot, this would be standing at the front of the line, waving its tattered flag of mediocrity. Tom Hardy's final outing as Eddie Brock/Venom is not just a disappointment-it's an insult to audiences everywhere. To call this movie bad would be a kindness. This is an incoherent, muddled, and utterly joyless mess that somehow manages to fall short of even the lowest expectations.The premise of Eddie and Venom being ""on the run"" from both worlds promised at least some thrilling action. Instead, what we get is a chaotic, poorly-scripted nightmare of disjointed scenes and absurd plot holes big enough to swallow the entire Marvel universe. The narrative, if you can call it that, lurches forward with all the grace of a drunken man stumbling in the dark. There is no rhyme or reason to the events that unfold. It's like the writers cobbled together every half-baked idea they could think of and hoped nobody would notice how little sense any of it makes.The so-called ""devastating decision"" that Eddie and Venom face feels less like a culmination of their journey and more like a cheap, hollow ploy to yank on the audience's emotions. But even that attempt falls flat because, by the time it arrives, the viewer is too exhausted from enduring 90 minutes of mindless drivel to care.Eddie Brock, once a complex and conflicted anti-hero from the source comics, is reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self, mumbling and stumbling through the film like he just wants to get it over with.The supporting characters are even worse-if that's possible. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use cardboard cutouts of side characters nobody cares about and clearly has no understanding of what made the earlier films (barely) work.They serve no purpose other than to waste screen time and remind us that, yes, someone actually wrote this drivel down on paper.It wouldn't be a Venom movie without over-the-top CGI battles, right? Well, unfortunately, the action scenes here are so poorly executed and short to save cost that even those who came purely for mindless entertainment will leave disappointed. The special effects are a headache-inducing blur of dark, indistinguishable shapes smashing into each other, with zero sense of tension or creativity.The final fight scene feels like -an unintelligible swirl of chaos that is supposed to distract us from the fact that nothing of consequence is happening. It's not exciting, it's not entertaining, it's just ugly.At its core it tries to sell itself as a dramatic, emotional farewell to Eddie and Venom's bond, but it doesn't even come close to achieving that. Any attempt at emotional weight is drowned by the film's clumsy pacing and complete lack of character development. The so-called ""devastating"" decision feels unearned, forced, and utterly unconvincing. There is no sense of closure, no satisfying payoff-just a hollow, empty finale that leaves you wondering why you wasted your time in the first place.Avoid this movie like the symbiote plague it is. Eddie and Venom deserved better. We all deserved better.Tom's ego and nepotism to promote his FWB director both of whom had sole credit of writing the script should tell you that how much he actually despises the franchise.Tom was the ultimate culprit is giving the first movie it's comic tone and had heated arguments with Ruben Flesicher on set to such an extent that filming halted for a few days. There were 3 script writers on the first movie can you guess who was one of them?It's the director of this movie who with her relationship strong armed and hijacked the plot elements and forced to introduce the comic tone into the first movie by reshooting the movie which had resulted in a disjointed mess.Even the Ruben had expressed his deep regrets about that but I guess if you can control the leading star you can have your way.If you closely look at the tone of the first movie first trailer you will notice the horror and science fiction elements present which had been stripped down to barebones and gag and quips reigned supreme.",Negative
765,"My wife and I watched Venom: The Last Dance (2024) last night in theaters. The storyline follows Eddie Brock, who is on the run from the law and hiding in Mexico. When an invasion from Venom's home world begins, Eddie must make his way to Area 51 to find reinforcements and fight off the invaders.Directed by Kelly Marcel in her directorial debut, the film stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Rhys Ifans (The Amazing Spider-Man), Stephen Graham (Snatch), and Juno Temple (Killer Joe).I absolutely loved the first two-thirds of this film. Tom Hardy nailed his role, bringing a perfect blend of humor, action, and Venom's signature appetite for chaos. The various forms Venom takes are visually entertaining, and the self-deprecating humor is spot-on. We especially enjoyed the introduction of a quirky ""hippie family,"" who added a fun twist. However, once the story shifts to Area 51, things feel rushed and forced. The other symbiotes look incredible, but they come and go so quickly that you're left wanting more. The villain's defeat also felt underwhelming, and I wanted a bit more depth in their storyline. The homage at the end felt somewhat awkward as well.In conclusion, Venom: The Last Dance is a fun watch and definitely worth seeing for fans of the character, though it doesn't quite reach its full potential. I'd rate it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Positive

767,"Venom 3 is fun movie. It will never be critically rated, but it doesn't need or try to be. It is fun, it is weird, it looks good and the interactions between Eddie and Venom are great as always and are funny unlike the forced jokes that don't always land. We get to see a bit more of the rest of the symbiotes, but it is not a major focus of the movie to introduce or highlight them, which was a bit disappointing personally. The storyline is a bit messy, and there are a few plotholes and illogical, unexplainable events, but the movie does a good job of actually taking the viewers through it. We get and ending to the trilogy that is pretty much what you expect, but the emotional charge of it feels a bit forced and doesn't let the viewer appreciate it for themselves. We also get a glimpse of what may come in the future, including a namedrop that comic fans will get, so we may see more of our goofy antihero in the future.",Positive
768,"Venom The Last Dance was hilarious, emotional and entertaining. Went in with the same expectations as before very low. I'm shocked about the critics, cause they expected much more unreal scenarios. Here again Sony is not stupid of course they'd have added a specific character in their world, but they probably can't because of a certain contract clause. The third movie is much better than the second cause the second movie suffered from extreme cuts which took out all its potential. Despite the fact that Venom was rumored and in productions ever since early 00s it's no wonder they made a trilogy and had box office success, cause Tom Hardy carried those movies on his own. Every other actor wouldn't be able to pull out this great chemistry between him and Venom. I'm not biased I see its flaws and weaknesses, but my God some critics thrashed this movie as if it's another Morbius or Madame Web. It's by far a better movie.The road trip family was adorable not necessary but there to add a more family atmosphere and emotional touch to this film. Juno Temple was good but underperformed and here background story was dragged into this movie.Ms Cheng was probably the best positive highlight of the movie besides the love for dogs and animals in general.A lot of great symbionts and designs were actually great to watch. I can't say much more to that point cause I want to avoid spoilers.The issuesThe plot and goal of the movie is clear but gets lost through the movie. The action sequences and CGI were average at best. I know that sounds awful for a higher rating, but hear me out. The cast was decent and some actors really shined here.Another problem is the camera work here too many fast cuts hardly to see specially when I think I was obligated to watch it in 3D. I prefer 2D.The biggest problem was there is no clear 1 v 1 villain here with heart and intentions. We have Knull as the big bad in the background but barely seen but only to bait us fans to watch it and another mystery character from the army or swat like crew not shown at all. Where as the first two movies had clear antagonists shown.Issue / or averageThe Ending was emotional and impactful with rushed bangs, but man there were some scenes I really felt touched by it. I still think they could've done more and Tom deserved more !I give it 6 but as a trilogy part and the Tom Hardy factor a light 7, cause reviews between 1-4 stars are harsh. And yeah don't leave there are two important post credit scenes. I'm really looking forward !",Positive

770,"Barely emotional. Barely funny. Barely mediocre. From this pattern, it can be deducted that Venom: The Last Dance is a passable movie that doesn't do enough right to feel like an epic send off, or do anything inherently wrong to be worth complaining about. It's just fine.Tom Hardy is once again the easy stand-out as Eddie Brock, using the same janky physical actions as Venom manipulates his movements to an entertaining degree. The humour is the same safe but fine lines of dialogue that either evoke a chuckle or short exhale of breath. The action scenes escalate in levels of excitement throughout the film, with the final act especially delivering some really fun mayhem. And being the supposed final film of the trilogy, there are some surprisingly tender moments sprinkled in, but aren't frequent enough to draw any real emotion.As aforementioned, the humour is fine but there's one particular segment of the film in Las Vegas that feels too ridiculous and reckless in the context of the movie. Moreover, the story sets up rules that either get contradicted, forgotten, or straight up ignored for the sake of 'cool' scenes. Aside from Eddie and Venom, the rest of the cast of characters come off as either underutilised, underdeveloped, or unnecessary. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rhys Ifans feel criminally wasted, Juno Temple and Clark Backo undermine each other as their characters could've been just compiled into one due to their similar traits, and Stephen Graham and Peggy Lu don't do much to feel properly utilised, especially Graham, who's character felt like was building up to a bigger pay-off than what we got. And the antagonist Knull was so sidelined that there's not much more to say about him other than 'he was in the movie'.In conclusion, for what Venom: The Last Dance can't deliver in a concise plot or compelling side characters, it manages to make up for it with fun symbiote action and mostly entertaining and semi-heartfelt sequences.",Negative
771,"Sony should publicly apologise to the audience for making this worst movie and make the audience suffer and wasted their time. So boring story, nothing to appreciate only actor (Tom Hardy) has done, good acting Else, everyone, not done anything to discuss, that's why am giving one star.Don't waste your money by going into the theatres. CGI was good, but story was so pathetic. You can just guess the whole picture by trailer waste of money. Tom Hardy should try superhero movies with other Studios sony is not good with superheroes. We have already seen this with Superman. Middle part was so boring and ending was too predictable.",Negative
772,"Venom: The Last Dance delivers exactly what it promises-an absurdly fun, high-octane ride with a surprising amount of heart. If you expected Avengers: Endgame level of finality, you walked into the wrong theater, but for those who wanted a dumb but entertaining alien-human bromance, this one's for you.This film is easily the best in the trilogy, blending sharp pacing, humor that actually lands, and action sequences that never feel forced. The weird yet charming dynamic between Eddie and Venom is in full swing, and the filmmakers know exactly how to tap into the ridiculous yet endearing relationship that has become the backbone of this series. It's self-aware without feeling desperate for laughs, striking a balance that's tough to nail in superhero movies these days.While some of the gore pushes the limits of PG-13, it's never gratuitous. There's enough bite to the violence to keep you hooked, but it stops short of being overwhelming. If anything, it adds a little edge to an otherwise slick, polished blockbuster.But the real kicker here is that, amidst all the chaos, Venom: The Last Dance sneaks in some genuine emotion. It's a film about keeping your best bro close, and somehow that works. So why all the hate? It's a popcorn flick that knows exactly what it is, and honestly, that's rare these days.",Positive
773,Almost the whole cast was full. The only cast members that helped was the family and of course the store lady. Mulligan was boring . I felt there was a power struggle when writing this. One wanted to show ase strong women yet made them look stupied and to emotional; while the other smart men but utterly useless in the long run causing more havoc and not thinking before moving.The CGI are as ok. The one creatures could have been way way more creative for sure.Over all it's a lack luster film unfortunately 😕..there's so much they could have done with Tom and this story line. We needed a version of him and Spider man yet have been robbed of that.,Negative
774,"First and foremost, it felt like the makers made every poor decision possible when it came to the sound tracks and music. That which is supposed to amplify the intensity of ride simply let it remain bland throughout, even the climax, even the falling action.With Venom and Eddie having largely ceased their bickering, their bromance has dwindled significantly in this movie. Being the conclusional piece of this hilarious trilogy, it has fallen short of many expectations.Of course there was some of those promised action as witnessed in the trailers. But was there something which swept me off my feet which was absent from the trailers? Not really.While the villain's back-story is rather solid, it could have been more centre-stage. Most of the characters that have made appearance in this movie felt weakly woven together; though the plot could not have moved forward without their roles, they barely left any impact. Speaking of the plot, it largely remains uneventful, with the makers just throwing a few name-sake 3D effect villainous creatures at our faces. There is only one major action sequence throughout the film, that it low-key has bottled down to something I would either skim through, or watch at a slightly increased playback speed.If the unnecessary scenes, and by that I mean, 'adding no humor or value to the plot' scenes were deleted, it could easily boil down to half its current run-time. That being said, there could definitely be leads from where this movie has left loose ends at, but presently, it stays far aloof from being involved in such a gifting.I feel like the last of the trilogy has not done justice to the previous two movies, it almost feels like watching a different character. The ending in particular came off to me as a tryhard terrific ending, and even if the clips were good, the track choices really did not work out for me.",Negative
775,"Eddie and Venom are on the run as fugitives after their battle with Carnage. They are chased by military force and aliens that want to capture them for their codex to unleash a greater evil in their world. Eddie and Venom venture out for a while avoiding authorities and the alien species.I am a fan of the first Venom movie. It is not a well-made movie, but it is so entertaining because of Tom Hardy's crazy performance in both roles and the wacky humor throughout the film. The second movie is much better made mainly because of Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris, but I actually enjoyed the first one more on a fun level. I was pretty excited for the third film and the trailers had me hooked. Does this trilogy end on a memorable last dance?I have mixed thoughts on Venom: The Last Dance. Let's start with the good. I love Eddie and Venom's dynamic and they are at their best in this movie. They have fun chemistry and banter and it feels like they are finally starting to get along with each other a bit better. They also have a few emotional moments that can come off as cheesy, but they have charm especially one scene where Eddie reassures Martin's son that his alien friend is there to help and Venom thanks the kid for a piece of chocolate. In a movie filled with silly moments and action-packed battles, it is a really sweet moment that shows how heroic Eddie and Venom have become.It helps that Tom Hardy is an absolute joy to watch. Hardy relishes in both of his roles and he never lets up. There are several moments of him doing stuff like going crazy at the slot machine and creating a drink at the bar by himself in a quick way. He also handles the more dramatic scenes very well making the more emotional moments work better than they should have.Also, Venom is a very cool character here. He is funny, his powers are awesome and he does anything to protect Eddie even knowing that if they are both alive the aliens will track them down because they have a codex. Venom's antics are very endearing and it seems like he just wants to join the fun and even tries to get Eddie to join in. I love watching him take control of other animals such as a horse, a fish and a frog. Venom is so much fun to watch and he is a good reason why I enjoy these movies despite their faults.The humor is for the most part pretty good. There is one gag that I cringed at but other than that, I got several laughs out of this movie. The banter between Eddie and Venom never gets old for me.The action scenes are pretty entertaining. The chase scene in the river is a standout because it looks cool, it has Eddie Brock defend himself without Venom and Venom turning into other creatures. It is also frenetic and fun to see play out. The climax is also big full of cool moments, but it is a little CGI heavy. However, it features Venom on a motorcycle again and it looks great. Overall, I enjoyed the action.The cinematography by Fabian Wagner is solid and colorful. The lighting is also on point with all of the scenes being lit well enough to see while having some flare in the shots. This is by far the best looking Venom movie filmmaking wise. The special effects are more polished and the alien creatures chasing Venom and Eddie look very menacing. Honestly, they kind of remind me of the Kaijus from Pacific Rim and I like that. There also other symbiotes in the film and they look very cool with their designs, but some of their colors blend in. The visuals are not perfect, but they are an upgrade from the last two movies.All that said, there are a few problems I have with this movie. The biggest problem is that the script is overstuffed. I know that there needs to other plot lines to have the story come together, but some of them do not work at all. The scientists subplot is one of the most boring parts of the movie with how slowly paced it is and how the tone shifts from fun to dreary and not the good kind of dreary. The subplot with Martin and his family is okay and has some great moments, but it can drag a little too long.The supporting cast does not hold a candle to Tom Hardy. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Rex Strickland is the best supporting performance, but his character is too unlikable to root for. Dr. Payne is kind of there until the climax. Clark Backo as Sadie Christmas is alright and she does a lot in the climax, but her character does not stand out until then. Rhys Ifans is having a lot of fun in his role as a family man who believes in aliens. While his family may have gotten a little more focus than they should have, Ifans is pretty fun to watch at times. Andy Serkis as Knull is absolutely wasted. He seems like a menacing villain, but he gets little to do aside from getting expository dialogue. By far, the weakest link in the film and wastes Andy Serkis on a limited role.The tone is all over the place. There are moments where this movie acts like a cheesy road trip comedy with Eddie and Venom and then the next scene could be overly serious research about the symbiotes. The movie progressively darker as it goes along and it has some moments that should come off as emotional and while they kind of work because of Tom Hardy's performance and the duo's likability, they feel a bit unearned because of how comedic this series is by now. When Eddie and Venom ponder the life they could have had when in the car with Martin's family, it is hard to feel anything because they have been two goofballs most of the time. Without spoiling anything, ending is a mixed bag for me because it is sad, but not a tearjerker like the movie wants it to be.The musical score by Dan Deacon makes no impression on me. It just sounds like generic music from any other movie. The needle drops are okay, but I wish they could find another song than Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. However, the credits song One Last Dance by Tom and Roman Morello and Grandson is really catchy and a great song to end the movie. Also, Maroon 5's Memories has a great needle drop here.Venom: The Last Dance is an entertaining movie. It is not well-made and not even as fun as the first film, but I overall had a pretty good time with the movie despite the many issues it has. I guess I cannot help but find Eddie and Venom a lot of fun to watch. Director Kelly Marcel did a great job with the scenes with those two and with the action scenes, but I think she bit off more than she could chew with the other subplots. If you like the Venom movies, you will probably enjoy this movie but if you never them then this movie will not change your mind.Stay through all of the credits.",Positive
776,"It is genuinely impressive that Sony managed to make the most mediocre trilogy ever with such an iconic character.In terms of enjoyment, Eddie and Venom continue to be a delightfully fun duo. In this 3rd movie, they are basically on a road trip and that was relatively entertaining for the most part. The final act of the movie was also a pretty enjoyable CGI action fest with some emotional scenes.However, the story and script are still as flat as ever. The narrative feels very half baked with it feeling like a chain of things just randomly happening. Pointless characters that don't add much. Jokes being thrown at you just to see which land. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor characters could have been played by anyone but feels purposely done because they knew fans recognised them from other Marvel projects. The villain Knull looks cool but is just there to be teased for future projects.Overall, it is better than the second film but just on par with the first. It is a mediocre final entry. Sony continues to disappoint with their universe and We all know Venom is coming back somehow. I do worry for Spiderman 4 and hope Sony don't mess that movie in anyway.",Neutral
777,"""Venom: The Last Dance' is a messy buddy road trip in which you must turn your brains off...again.Is it perfect? Nah, far from it. I think there are way too many storylines in here, and the main one got some potential, but it was wasted in typical Sony fashion. The ""Spider-Man 4"" rumors have been blown out of proportion in my opinion, so temper your expectations.The duo between Eddie and Venom is as fun as always. I mean Tom Hardy and the banter between them...I'm sorry, the banter between Hardy and himself is the best part of these movies (Hardy is doing the voice of Venom).The humor is there, but can't say I laughed all that much, beacause most of the jokes are base level childish again. It must be a bit more emotional as a whole, because supposedly is the last time we see Venom (hardly doubt), but it ends up kinda hollow.Knull is there...I guess, but will see how and when they'll use him again...it's Sony after all.It's a popcorn movie that reminds me of the early 2000's comic book movies. The action in the third act is good for the most parts and there are some funny moments here and there. Are there plot holes and some issues with the story? Yes. It's just another ""Turn your brains off"" Sony movie again.There are two credit scenes, first one is kinda important, the second one not so much.",Positive
778,"My relationship with the Venom franchise has been rocky. I have a soft spot for the first one, absolutely loathe the second, and now we come to the trilogy's closer, and thankfully, it's an improvement.Venom: The Last Dance works best when it focuses on Eddie and Venom's story instead of trying to set up the future of the Sonyverse. If you didn't like the previous Venom films, this won't change your mind. It's still messy, but it gets more right than its predecessors.This is easily the campiest and most mature of the bunch. It takes its time with the characters, letting us sit with them instead of rushing into the next action set piece. Still being PG-13 it manages to cram in a lot more gore than its predecessors. The action is inventive, and the humor hits its mark. It also doesn't shy away from getting personal and emotional. Eddie and Venom's relationship has never felt more genuine. I'll admit-I teared up a few times by the end.Some may be disappointed by the potrayal of Knull, but personally, I loved it. He feels like an overlooming threat rather than an one-off villain, and the ""God of Darkness"" gets a Thanos-esque treatment he deserves.Now, don't get me wrong-the movie is still bad, technically speaking-but it's self-aware about that. Instead of being ""bad bad,"" it chooses to be ""fun bad"" and entertain you, and I respect that. Not every movie needs to be great; sometimes being fun is enough.Even with the lows, I have always found a weird sense of comfort with this rendition of Venom. I have found myself caring more for these characters than maybe even the script intended. So I am happy to say that by the end, it does enough to justify this trilogy's existence - and to such an satisfying extent that I'd rather live in a world where the Venom movies exist than one where it doesn't.",Positive
779,"The third installment about the symbiotic anti-hero is a mix of bright moments and disappointments. Tom Hardy once again proves why he is the perfect choice for the role of Eddie Brock/Venom, but even his charismatic performance cannot save the unbalanced ensemble. The film starts off promisingly - with dynamic action and witty dialogue between Eddie and his symbiotic companion. Their relationship is still the best the series has to offer. Hardy brilliantly manages both comedic timing and dramatic moments. The visual effects are impressive in places, especially in the action sequences where Venom shows off his abilities. At other times, however, the CGI feels inadequate and more reminiscent of a video game from the last decade. Some fights are well choreographed, others are a chaotic mix of digital effects. The biggest problem is the script, which tries to be too ambitious. It mixes several storylines, introduces new characters and antagonists, but does not give them enough space to develop. The result is a rushed pace and superficial characters. The film's darker tone is a welcome change, but it often clashes with the comedic elements, creating an unbalanced whole. The film seems unsure whether it wants to be a serious drama or a lighthearted entertainment. Venom: The Last Dance is like a roller coaster - it's ups and downs. For fans of the series, it offers enough fun, but it's hard to call it a significant step forward. This film is like an average song on a great album, but as a whole it doesn't leave a strong impression. Fans will find their own, others may be disappointed.",Positive
780,"Maybe it's just because of my low expectations toward the series but it was just fun to watch. I've already lost hope for the trilogy to have a decent plot but I can say that this one has a better storyline than the second film.CGI was fine, I coudn't find any disturbing point. It was interesting to see the other symbiotes. I think those new symbiotes showed more symbiote-ish action scenes than venom when it comes to the fight ironically.There were a few funny jokes that made me laugh but I didn't really find Eddie's weird obsession for shoes funny, like was it supposed to be funny? Guess it was meant to be humor but well... it was almost tiring.",Neutral
781,"A solid enough send off for this 'Venom' trilogy.'Venom: The Last Dance' is decently amusing and produces enough entertainment with its plot. I didn't personally find it overly funny, though the person a few seats across from me had an absolute blast - never a bad thing seeing people enjoy themselves!Tom Hardy remains the key element of these films, they would be far less enjoyable without his presence. There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor stick out most from the other characters.",Negative

783,"Being Rated R probably would have saved this; I am just saying!This trilogy-capper almost makes me question if I have become more of a movie critic than a movie enjoyer. Then I remembered this is Sony's Spider-Man Universe we are talking about, which gave us films like ""Morbius"" and ""Madame Web."" I nonetheless went in here with an open mind, considering I do not mind the two previous ""Venom"" films that came out. After seeing ""The Last Dance,"" I question whether Sony was trying to set up their universe or give Eddie Brock and Venom the send-off they deserve. I am sadly leaning more toward the former.I should preface this review by telling you what I thought of the other two ""Venom"" films upon rewatch in preparation for this third installment. Those were entertaining yet disappointing superhero films saved by the performance of Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and Venom. The first was innocent enough, with a dull first and more engaging second half, a weak villain in Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake/Riot, exciting action, and Hardy performing nicely. Its sequel, ""Let There Be Carnage,"" surprisingly got better when revisiting it, easily surpassing its predecessor, with Hardy allowed to stretch his comedic abilities with Brock and Venom bickering hilariously. In addition, there is Woody Harrelson's enjoyable performance as Cletus Kasady/Carnage, who manages to rise above the flaws, including the disappointing inclusion of Naomie Harris' Frances Barrison/Shriek. Hardy was allowed to have fun with his characters, and the movies complimented him with a narrative that was not too complicated. The opposite is true for ""The Last Dance.""Let's get the positives out of the way first. It is a short list, which I am deeply saddened by, but I want to show you how it is not the worst superhero film out there or even the worst film of the year.Despite a woeful screenplay, Tom Hardy still does skillfully with Eddie Brock and Venom. He is not allowed to have as much fun as he did in the prior two films, but he is trying his best (right, the positives. Sorry).The rest of the cast delivered equally solid performances, with the other standout being Chiwetel Ejiofor as Orwell Taylor. Ejiofor always has a commanding presence whenever he is in a movie, with his characters of Baron Mordo in the two ""Doctor Strange"" films and Bathurst 2020 in the forgettable ""Infinite"" being the two I can think of at the top of my head. Even if the film is not the best, Ejiofor makes it work, and if it is fantastic, he always steals the show.The visual effects bring Venom and the other alien characters to gorgeous life. The other two ""Venom"" movies, granted, had remarkable CGI, but it is worth mentioning, specifically when discussing the positives.The action is somewhat fun. The ""Venom"" movies have always had enjoyable action. Unfortunately, ""The Last Dance"" was the least fun action-wise, but the first scene with action was sweet.The Venom symbiote is sometimes uniquely utilized. The trailers showcased Venom controlling a horse, and in the film, it is one of its best scenes. I am unsure if this is a spoiler, but he controls other animals, and they introduce other symbiotes, which is fun.I think that is it for the positives.I felt the portrayal of Eddie Brock and Venom this time was not good. Again, Hardy tried, but there were multiple times when it felt like he was bored. His character was, admittedly, bored at intervals, and Hardy is a screenwriter, but I am saying how it felt.The film tries to add new characters, but they are not compelling. The most obvious example is Dr. Payne, played by Juno Temple, who does nothing aside from believing that Brock is not a danger, while Ejiofor wants what is best for the world, considering the alien threat from Knull.Speaking of Knull, he was worse than Carlton Drake. He only sends alien minions to grab a MacGuffin that Venom has. I have not read the comics, but the impression I get from others and this movie is that Knull has a profound lore not represented here. Having Knull's alien pals and the Area 51 agents as the villains is too much, yet somehow too little.They also wasted Stephen Graham's Detective Mulligan. The trailers made it seem like Mulligan would be a principal and intriguing character. The only two interesting aspects about Mulligan are he has a symbiote and warns of Knull. That is it.Furthermore, it does not have that much comedy. ""Let There Be Carnage"" can easily be classified as a comedy, and I laughed more than I would like to admit. I think two laughs and three to five chuckles were all I had here. The film was not funny outside of the Venom horse and some banter between Brock and Venom.On top of that, there was not that much emotion. It is due to how much Brock and Venom were not well utilized and the clutter of characters. I did not care about the Area 51 personnel nor the unnamed family who brought Brock and Venom to Vegas. When the ending came along, which heightened the stakes to an unbelievable degree, I did not get emotional. It tried, but it failed to work.The other two ""Venom"" movies were entertaining, but this failed to come close. In an era where ""superhero fatigue"" is becoming more accepted, this trilogy-closer did not try anything new. Fascinating concepts here and there, and many standout scenes fail to save this disappointment in a franchise filled with them.Technically, a 6/10. Outside of the plot and the underwhelming screenplay, the visual effects remain exceptional, the actors did great, and the film functions.For the enjoyment score, I wanted to like this film. I had the sneaking suspicion that it might not work, but watching ""Let There Be Carnage"" increase in quality gave me hope. It was no ""Let There Be Carnage"" and is easily the weakest of the trilogy. It had the issues that plagued the likes of ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but does not come close to being as entertaining as them. I am so unhappy that the enjoyment score is a 4/10, but this trilogy deserved a better conclusion. Maybe it will get better when I watch it again, but as it stands, it is best for me to recommend you wait until Netflix or even Disney+.",Positive
784,"This movie was very middle of the road to me. Definitely better than the second one, but not as good as the original.I enjoyed the beginning very much. Nice pace, good story and funny at times. Also the last part was packed with action and it all looked amazing. Only thing I missed was some sort of a climax at the very end.The middle however, I did not care for too much. Some things felt forced, rushed and very unlikely. But as I often say in my reviews: 'It is a fictional, fantasy, action movie so who cares if some things do not add up.'As a whole I enjoyed it very much, Tom Hardy did not disappoint.",Positive
785,"I just don't get it, I thought the 1st Venom was good despite many fans may not have liked it. I'm not a comic fan, so for me it was good that they try to make it as relatable and realistic to just your average movie goer.The 2nd film was cringy and terrible in my opinion because the story didn't make much sense, too much drama, poetry, and bromance. I lost interest after watching that one but the trailer for this film looked good.Right from the beginning I realize this was going to be bad. I don't care about the multi-verse, I don't care about Knull, I don't care about all these comic lores. The story is completely unrelatable and the suspension of disbelief failed early on.And then to top it off, the ending was just awful.4/10 for the special effects. Everything else is a 0.",Negative
786,"If you've already come to terms with this version of Venom and Eddie Brock as more of a bromance than the savage, brutal duo from the comics, you're in for a fun ride, Venom: The Last Dance, the final chapter of the trilogy, delivers an entertaining ride with solid pacing, good performances, decent visual effects, and fun engaging enough story, added also with the joy of let all the madness fan service out makes Venom: The Last Dance an easy good time especially for me, even the serious part mostly with Chiwetel Ejiofor was executed pretty well, surprising wholesome moments with Rhys Ifans and his family characters, flawed? Sure, some of the editing cuts didn't quite work for me, there were a few cheesy, awkward moments that felt off, and nit picky here and there, overall, i have a good time with Venom: The Last Dance, and the most surprising thing also the least thing i could expect watching this supposed to be last time we'll see both Venom and Eddie was that i did get quite emotional at the end, it's clear they've evolved from mere host and symbiote to something much deeper, and their dynamic was surprisingly touching, my personal experience with these two also comes as long as these three movies together, and as the movie itself whether it's better than the first one which also a good movie in my opinion, The Last Dance succeeded my expectation from being far from bad, i want this goodbye to be at least watchable enough, and the result is more than that, Venom: The Last Dance is actually a good film, just like Venom would say, We are Venom, and this film makes sure we feel it.",Negative

788,"If you were hoping for a grand finale to the Venom franchise that would surpass the comedic heights of its predecessors, you're in for a letdown. While Venom: The Last Dance does deliver on the comedic front, it falls short in nearly every other aspect.The film picks up right where we left off, with Eddie Brock and Venom still on the run. The plot takes a convoluted turn as they become embroiled in a government conspiracy involving symbiotes and a dangerous threat to the universe. While the premise is intriguing, the execution feels rushed and often confusing.The real draw of this film, as with its predecessors, is the chemistry between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom. Their banter and witty exchanges provide much-needed humor and keep the film entertaining. However, the comedic elements can feel forced at times, and the overall tone can be uneven.The film's biggest flaw is its reliance on poor CGI and even worse dialogue. The visual effects, particularly those involving the titular symbiote, often feel like a step back from previous entries. Venom's appearances are fleeting, and when he does appear in full form, he's often overshadowed by lackluster animation.The script is equally disappointing. The story lacks depth and originality, and the characters feel one-dimensional. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the pacing feels uneven. While there are a few moments of humor that might elicit a chuckle, they're not enough to salvage the film.Ultimately, Venom: The Last Dance is a missed opportunity. It's a shame that such a potentially fun franchise has ended on such a sour note.",Negative
789,"If cinematic catastrophes could have a mascot, this would be standing at the front of the line, waving its tattered flag of mediocrity. Tom Hardy's final outing as Eddie Brock/Venom is not just a disappointment-it's an insult to audiences everywhere. To call this movie bad would be a kindness. This is an incoherent, muddled, and utterly joyless mess that somehow manages to fall short of even the lowest expectations.The premise of Eddie and Venom being ""on the run"" from both worlds promised at least some thrilling action. Instead, what we get is a chaotic, poorly-scripted nightmare of disjointed scenes and absurd plot holes big enough to swallow the entire Marvel universe. The narrative, if you can call it that, lurches forward with all the grace of a drunken man stumbling in the dark. There is no rhyme or reason to the events that unfold. It's like the writers cobbled together every half-baked idea they could think of and hoped nobody would notice how little sense any of it makes.The so-called ""devastating decision"" that Eddie and Venom face feels less like a culmination of their journey and more like a cheap, hollow ploy to yank on the audience's emotions. But even that attempt falls flat because, by the time it arrives, the viewer is too exhausted from enduring 90 minutes of mindless drivel to care.Eddie Brock, once a complex and conflicted anti-hero from the source comics, is reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self, mumbling and stumbling through the film like he just wants to get it over with.The supporting characters are even worse-if that's possible. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use cardboard cutouts of side characters nobody cares about and clearly has no understanding of what made the earlier films (barely) work.They serve no purpose other than to waste screen time and remind us that, yes, someone actually wrote this drivel down on paper.It wouldn't be a Venom movie without over-the-top CGI battles, right? Well, unfortunately, the action scenes here are so poorly executed and short to save cost that even those who came purely for mindless entertainment will leave disappointed. The special effects are a headache-inducing blur of dark, indistinguishable shapes smashing into each other, with zero sense of tension or creativity.The final fight scene feels like -an unintelligible swirl of chaos that is supposed to distract us from the fact that nothing of consequence is happening. It's not exciting, it's not entertaining, it's just ugly.At its core it tries to sell itself as a dramatic, emotional farewell to Eddie and Venom's bond, but it doesn't even come close to achieving that. Any attempt at emotional weight is drowned by the film's clumsy pacing and complete lack of character development. The so-called ""devastating"" decision feels unearned, forced, and utterly unconvincing. There is no sense of closure, no satisfying payoff-just a hollow, empty finale that leaves you wondering why you wasted your time in the first place.Avoid this movie like the symbiote plague it is. Eddie and Venom deserved better. We all deserved better.Tom's ego and nepotism to promote his FWB director both of whom had sole credit of writing the script should tell you that how much he actually despises the franchise.Tom was the ultimate culprit is giving the first movie it's comic tone and had heated arguments with Ruben Flesicher on set to such an extent that filming halted for a few days. There were 3 script writers on the first movie can you guess who was one of them?It's the director of this movie who with her relationship strong armed and hijacked the plot elements and forced to introduce the comic tone into the first movie by reshooting the movie which had resulted in a disjointed mess.Even the Ruben had expressed his deep regrets about that but I guess if you can control the leading star you can have your way.If you closely look at the tone of the first movie first trailer you will notice the horror and science fiction elements present which had been stripped down to barebones and gag and quips reigned supreme.",Negative
790,"My wife and I watched Venom: The Last Dance (2024) last night in theaters. The storyline follows Eddie Brock, who is on the run from the law and hiding in Mexico. When an invasion from Venom's home world begins, Eddie must make his way to Area 51 to find reinforcements and fight off the invaders.Directed by Kelly Marcel in her directorial debut, the film stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Rhys Ifans (The Amazing Spider-Man), Stephen Graham (Snatch), and Juno Temple (Killer Joe).I absolutely loved the first two-thirds of this film. Tom Hardy nailed his role, bringing a perfect blend of humor, action, and Venom's signature appetite for chaos. The various forms Venom takes are visually entertaining, and the self-deprecating humor is spot-on. We especially enjoyed the introduction of a quirky ""hippie family,"" who added a fun twist. However, once the story shifts to Area 51, things feel rushed and forced. The other symbiotes look incredible, but they come and go so quickly that you're left wanting more. The villain's defeat also felt underwhelming, and I wanted a bit more depth in their storyline. The homage at the end felt somewhat awkward as well.In conclusion, Venom: The Last Dance is a fun watch and definitely worth seeing for fans of the character, though it doesn't quite reach its full potential. I'd rate it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Positive

792,"Venom 3 is fun movie. It will never be critically rated, but it doesn't need or try to be. It is fun, it is weird, it looks good and the interactions between Eddie and Venom are great as always and are funny unlike the forced jokes that don't always land. We get to see a bit more of the rest of the symbiotes, but it is not a major focus of the movie to introduce or highlight them, which was a bit disappointing personally. The storyline is a bit messy, and there are a few plotholes and illogical, unexplainable events, but the movie does a good job of actually taking the viewers through it. We get and ending to the trilogy that is pretty much what you expect, but the emotional charge of it feels a bit forced and doesn't let the viewer appreciate it for themselves. We also get a glimpse of what may come in the future, including a namedrop that comic fans will get, so we may see more of our goofy antihero in the future.",Positive
793,"Venom The Last Dance was hilarious, emotional and entertaining. Went in with the same expectations as before very low. I'm shocked about the critics, cause they expected much more unreal scenarios. Here again Sony is not stupid of course they'd have added a specific character in their world, but they probably can't because of a certain contract clause. The third movie is much better than the second cause the second movie suffered from extreme cuts which took out all its potential. Despite the fact that Venom was rumored and in productions ever since early 00s it's no wonder they made a trilogy and had box office success, cause Tom Hardy carried those movies on his own. Every other actor wouldn't be able to pull out this great chemistry between him and Venom. I'm not biased I see its flaws and weaknesses, but my God some critics thrashed this movie as if it's another Morbius or Madame Web. It's by far a better movie.The road trip family was adorable not necessary but there to add a more family atmosphere and emotional touch to this film. Juno Temple was good but underperformed and here background story was dragged into this movie.Ms Cheng was probably the best positive highlight of the movie besides the love for dogs and animals in general.A lot of great symbionts and designs were actually great to watch. I can't say much more to that point cause I want to avoid spoilers.The issuesThe plot and goal of the movie is clear but gets lost through the movie. The action sequences and CGI were average at best. I know that sounds awful for a higher rating, but hear me out. The cast was decent and some actors really shined here.Another problem is the camera work here too many fast cuts hardly to see specially when I think I was obligated to watch it in 3D. I prefer 2D.The biggest problem was there is no clear 1 v 1 villain here with heart and intentions. We have Knull as the big bad in the background but barely seen but only to bait us fans to watch it and another mystery character from the army or swat like crew not shown at all. Where as the first two movies had clear antagonists shown.Issue / or averageThe Ending was emotional and impactful with rushed bangs, but man there were some scenes I really felt touched by it. I still think they could've done more and Tom deserved more !I give it 6 but as a trilogy part and the Tom Hardy factor a light 7, cause reviews between 1-4 stars are harsh. And yeah don't leave there are two important post credit scenes. I'm really looking forward !",Positive

795,"Barely emotional. Barely funny. Barely mediocre. From this pattern, it can be deducted that Venom: The Last Dance is a passable movie that doesn't do enough right to feel like an epic send off, or do anything inherently wrong to be worth complaining about. It's just fine.Tom Hardy is once again the easy stand-out as Eddie Brock, using the same janky physical actions as Venom manipulates his movements to an entertaining degree. The humour is the same safe but fine lines of dialogue that either evoke a chuckle or short exhale of breath. The action scenes escalate in levels of excitement throughout the film, with the final act especially delivering some really fun mayhem. And being the supposed final film of the trilogy, there are some surprisingly tender moments sprinkled in, but aren't frequent enough to draw any real emotion.As aforementioned, the humour is fine but there's one particular segment of the film in Las Vegas that feels too ridiculous and reckless in the context of the movie. Moreover, the story sets up rules that either get contradicted, forgotten, or straight up ignored for the sake of 'cool' scenes. Aside from Eddie and Venom, the rest of the cast of characters come off as either underutilised, underdeveloped, or unnecessary. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rhys Ifans feel criminally wasted, Juno Temple and Clark Backo undermine each other as their characters could've been just compiled into one due to their similar traits, and Stephen Graham and Peggy Lu don't do much to feel properly utilised, especially Graham, who's character felt like was building up to a bigger pay-off than what we got. And the antagonist Knull was so sidelined that there's not much more to say about him other than 'he was in the movie'.In conclusion, for what Venom: The Last Dance can't deliver in a concise plot or compelling side characters, it manages to make up for it with fun symbiote action and mostly entertaining and semi-heartfelt sequences.",Negative
796,"Sony should publicly apologise to the audience for making this worst movie and make the audience suffer and wasted their time. So boring story, nothing to appreciate only actor (Tom Hardy) has done, good acting Else, everyone, not done anything to discuss, that's why am giving one star.Don't waste your money by going into the theatres. CGI was good, but story was so pathetic. You can just guess the whole picture by trailer waste of money. Tom Hardy should try superhero movies with other Studios sony is not good with superheroes. We have already seen this with Superman. Middle part was so boring and ending was too predictable.",Negative
797,"Venom: The Last Dance delivers exactly what it promises-an absurdly fun, high-octane ride with a surprising amount of heart. If you expected Avengers: Endgame level of finality, you walked into the wrong theater, but for those who wanted a dumb but entertaining alien-human bromance, this one's for you.This film is easily the best in the trilogy, blending sharp pacing, humor that actually lands, and action sequences that never feel forced. The weird yet charming dynamic between Eddie and Venom is in full swing, and the filmmakers know exactly how to tap into the ridiculous yet endearing relationship that has become the backbone of this series. It's self-aware without feeling desperate for laughs, striking a balance that's tough to nail in superhero movies these days.While some of the gore pushes the limits of PG-13, it's never gratuitous. There's enough bite to the violence to keep you hooked, but it stops short of being overwhelming. If anything, it adds a little edge to an otherwise slick, polished blockbuster.But the real kicker here is that, amidst all the chaos, Venom: The Last Dance sneaks in some genuine emotion. It's a film about keeping your best bro close, and somehow that works. So why all the hate? It's a popcorn flick that knows exactly what it is, and honestly, that's rare these days.",Positive
798,Almost the whole cast was full. The only cast members that helped was the family and of course the store lady. Mulligan was boring . I felt there was a power struggle when writing this. One wanted to show ase strong women yet made them look stupied and to emotional; while the other smart men but utterly useless in the long run causing more havoc and not thinking before moving.The CGI are as ok. The one creatures could have been way way more creative for sure.Over all it's a lack luster film unfortunately 😕..there's so much they could have done with Tom and this story line. We needed a version of him and Spider man yet have been robbed of that.,Negative
799,"First and foremost, it felt like the makers made every poor decision possible when it came to the sound tracks and music. That which is supposed to amplify the intensity of ride simply let it remain bland throughout, even the climax, even the falling action.With Venom and Eddie having largely ceased their bickering, their bromance has dwindled significantly in this movie. Being the conclusional piece of this hilarious trilogy, it has fallen short of many expectations.Of course there was some of those promised action as witnessed in the trailers. But was there something which swept me off my feet which was absent from the trailers? Not really.While the villain's back-story is rather solid, it could have been more centre-stage. Most of the characters that have made appearance in this movie felt weakly woven together; though the plot could not have moved forward without their roles, they barely left any impact. Speaking of the plot, it largely remains uneventful, with the makers just throwing a few name-sake 3D effect villainous creatures at our faces. There is only one major action sequence throughout the film, that it low-key has bottled down to something I would either skim through, or watch at a slightly increased playback speed.If the unnecessary scenes, and by that I mean, 'adding no humor or value to the plot' scenes were deleted, it could easily boil down to half its current run-time. That being said, there could definitely be leads from where this movie has left loose ends at, but presently, it stays far aloof from being involved in such a gifting.I feel like the last of the trilogy has not done justice to the previous two movies, it almost feels like watching a different character. The ending in particular came off to me as a tryhard terrific ending, and even if the clips were good, the track choices really did not work out for me.",Negative
800,"Eddie and Venom are on the run as fugitives after their battle with Carnage. They are chased by military force and aliens that want to capture them for their codex to unleash a greater evil in their world. Eddie and Venom venture out for a while avoiding authorities and the alien species.I am a fan of the first Venom movie. It is not a well-made movie, but it is so entertaining because of Tom Hardy's crazy performance in both roles and the wacky humor throughout the film. The second movie is much better made mainly because of Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris, but I actually enjoyed the first one more on a fun level. I was pretty excited for the third film and the trailers had me hooked. Does this trilogy end on a memorable last dance?I have mixed thoughts on Venom: The Last Dance. Let's start with the good. I love Eddie and Venom's dynamic and they are at their best in this movie. They have fun chemistry and banter and it feels like they are finally starting to get along with each other a bit better. They also have a few emotional moments that can come off as cheesy, but they have charm especially one scene where Eddie reassures Martin's son that his alien friend is there to help and Venom thanks the kid for a piece of chocolate. In a movie filled with silly moments and action-packed battles, it is a really sweet moment that shows how heroic Eddie and Venom have become.It helps that Tom Hardy is an absolute joy to watch. Hardy relishes in both of his roles and he never lets up. There are several moments of him doing stuff like going crazy at the slot machine and creating a drink at the bar by himself in a quick way. He also handles the more dramatic scenes very well making the more emotional moments work better than they should have.Also, Venom is a very cool character here. He is funny, his powers are awesome and he does anything to protect Eddie even knowing that if they are both alive the aliens will track them down because they have a codex. Venom's antics are very endearing and it seems like he just wants to join the fun and even tries to get Eddie to join in. I love watching him take control of other animals such as a horse, a fish and a frog. Venom is so much fun to watch and he is a good reason why I enjoy these movies despite their faults.The humor is for the most part pretty good. There is one gag that I cringed at but other than that, I got several laughs out of this movie. The banter between Eddie and Venom never gets old for me.The action scenes are pretty entertaining. The chase scene in the river is a standout because it looks cool, it has Eddie Brock defend himself without Venom and Venom turning into other creatures. It is also frenetic and fun to see play out. The climax is also big full of cool moments, but it is a little CGI heavy. However, it features Venom on a motorcycle again and it looks great. Overall, I enjoyed the action.The cinematography by Fabian Wagner is solid and colorful. The lighting is also on point with all of the scenes being lit well enough to see while having some flare in the shots. This is by far the best looking Venom movie filmmaking wise. The special effects are more polished and the alien creatures chasing Venom and Eddie look very menacing. Honestly, they kind of remind me of the Kaijus from Pacific Rim and I like that. There also other symbiotes in the film and they look very cool with their designs, but some of their colors blend in. The visuals are not perfect, but they are an upgrade from the last two movies.All that said, there are a few problems I have with this movie. The biggest problem is that the script is overstuffed. I know that there needs to other plot lines to have the story come together, but some of them do not work at all. The scientists subplot is one of the most boring parts of the movie with how slowly paced it is and how the tone shifts from fun to dreary and not the good kind of dreary. The subplot with Martin and his family is okay and has some great moments, but it can drag a little too long.The supporting cast does not hold a candle to Tom Hardy. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Rex Strickland is the best supporting performance, but his character is too unlikable to root for. Dr. Payne is kind of there until the climax. Clark Backo as Sadie Christmas is alright and she does a lot in the climax, but her character does not stand out until then. Rhys Ifans is having a lot of fun in his role as a family man who believes in aliens. While his family may have gotten a little more focus than they should have, Ifans is pretty fun to watch at times. Andy Serkis as Knull is absolutely wasted. He seems like a menacing villain, but he gets little to do aside from getting expository dialogue. By far, the weakest link in the film and wastes Andy Serkis on a limited role.The tone is all over the place. There are moments where this movie acts like a cheesy road trip comedy with Eddie and Venom and then the next scene could be overly serious research about the symbiotes. The movie progressively darker as it goes along and it has some moments that should come off as emotional and while they kind of work because of Tom Hardy's performance and the duo's likability, they feel a bit unearned because of how comedic this series is by now. When Eddie and Venom ponder the life they could have had when in the car with Martin's family, it is hard to feel anything because they have been two goofballs most of the time. Without spoiling anything, ending is a mixed bag for me because it is sad, but not a tearjerker like the movie wants it to be.The musical score by Dan Deacon makes no impression on me. It just sounds like generic music from any other movie. The needle drops are okay, but I wish they could find another song than Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. However, the credits song One Last Dance by Tom and Roman Morello and Grandson is really catchy and a great song to end the movie. Also, Maroon 5's Memories has a great needle drop here.Venom: The Last Dance is an entertaining movie. It is not well-made and not even as fun as the first film, but I overall had a pretty good time with the movie despite the many issues it has. I guess I cannot help but find Eddie and Venom a lot of fun to watch. Director Kelly Marcel did a great job with the scenes with those two and with the action scenes, but I think she bit off more than she could chew with the other subplots. If you like the Venom movies, you will probably enjoy this movie but if you never them then this movie will not change your mind.Stay through all of the credits.",Positive
801,"It is genuinely impressive that Sony managed to make the most mediocre trilogy ever with such an iconic character.In terms of enjoyment, Eddie and Venom continue to be a delightfully fun duo. In this 3rd movie, they are basically on a road trip and that was relatively entertaining for the most part. The final act of the movie was also a pretty enjoyable CGI action fest with some emotional scenes.However, the story and script are still as flat as ever. The narrative feels very half baked with it feeling like a chain of things just randomly happening. Pointless characters that don't add much. Jokes being thrown at you just to see which land. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor characters could have been played by anyone but feels purposely done because they knew fans recognised them from other Marvel projects. The villain Knull looks cool but is just there to be teased for future projects.Overall, it is better than the second film but just on par with the first. It is a mediocre final entry. Sony continues to disappoint with their universe and We all know Venom is coming back somehow. I do worry for Spiderman 4 and hope Sony don't mess that movie in anyway.",Neutral
802,"""Venom: The Last Dance' is a messy buddy road trip in which you must turn your brains off...again.Is it perfect? Nah, far from it. I think there are way too many storylines in here, and the main one got some potential, but it was wasted in typical Sony fashion. The ""Spider-Man 4"" rumors have been blown out of proportion in my opinion, so temper your expectations.The duo between Eddie and Venom is as fun as always. I mean Tom Hardy and the banter between them...I'm sorry, the banter between Hardy and himself is the best part of these movies (Hardy is doing the voice of Venom).The humor is there, but can't say I laughed all that much, beacause most of the jokes are base level childish again. It must be a bit more emotional as a whole, because supposedly is the last time we see Venom (hardly doubt), but it ends up kinda hollow.Knull is there...I guess, but will see how and when they'll use him again...it's Sony after all.It's a popcorn movie that reminds me of the early 2000's comic book movies. The action in the third act is good for the most parts and there are some funny moments here and there. Are there plot holes and some issues with the story? Yes. It's just another ""Turn your brains off"" Sony movie again.There are two credit scenes, first one is kinda important, the second one not so much.",Positive
803,"My relationship with the Venom franchise has been rocky. I have a soft spot for the first one, absolutely loathe the second, and now we come to the trilogy's closer, and thankfully, it's an improvement.Venom: The Last Dance works best when it focuses on Eddie and Venom's story instead of trying to set up the future of the Sonyverse. If you didn't like the previous Venom films, this won't change your mind. It's still messy, but it gets more right than its predecessors.This is easily the campiest and most mature of the bunch. It takes its time with the characters, letting us sit with them instead of rushing into the next action set piece. Still being PG-13 it manages to cram in a lot more gore than its predecessors. The action is inventive, and the humor hits its mark. It also doesn't shy away from getting personal and emotional. Eddie and Venom's relationship has never felt more genuine. I'll admit-I teared up a few times by the end.Some may be disappointed by the potrayal of Knull, but personally, I loved it. He feels like an overlooming threat rather than an one-off villain, and the ""God of Darkness"" gets a Thanos-esque treatment he deserves.Now, don't get me wrong-the movie is still bad, technically speaking-but it's self-aware about that. Instead of being ""bad bad,"" it chooses to be ""fun bad"" and entertain you, and I respect that. Not every movie needs to be great; sometimes being fun is enough.Even with the lows, I have always found a weird sense of comfort with this rendition of Venom. I have found myself caring more for these characters than maybe even the script intended. So I am happy to say that by the end, it does enough to justify this trilogy's existence - and to such an satisfying extent that I'd rather live in a world where the Venom movies exist than one where it doesn't.",Positive
804,"The third installment about the symbiotic anti-hero is a mix of bright moments and disappointments. Tom Hardy once again proves why he is the perfect choice for the role of Eddie Brock/Venom, but even his charismatic performance cannot save the unbalanced ensemble. The film starts off promisingly - with dynamic action and witty dialogue between Eddie and his symbiotic companion. Their relationship is still the best the series has to offer. Hardy brilliantly manages both comedic timing and dramatic moments. The visual effects are impressive in places, especially in the action sequences where Venom shows off his abilities. At other times, however, the CGI feels inadequate and more reminiscent of a video game from the last decade. Some fights are well choreographed, others are a chaotic mix of digital effects. The biggest problem is the script, which tries to be too ambitious. It mixes several storylines, introduces new characters and antagonists, but does not give them enough space to develop. The result is a rushed pace and superficial characters. The film's darker tone is a welcome change, but it often clashes with the comedic elements, creating an unbalanced whole. The film seems unsure whether it wants to be a serious drama or a lighthearted entertainment. Venom: The Last Dance is like a roller coaster - it's ups and downs. For fans of the series, it offers enough fun, but it's hard to call it a significant step forward. This film is like an average song on a great album, but as a whole it doesn't leave a strong impression. Fans will find their own, others may be disappointed.",Positive
805,"Maybe it's just because of my low expectations toward the series but it was just fun to watch. I've already lost hope for the trilogy to have a decent plot but I can say that this one has a better storyline than the second film.CGI was fine, I coudn't find any disturbing point. It was interesting to see the other symbiotes. I think those new symbiotes showed more symbiote-ish action scenes than venom when it comes to the fight ironically.There were a few funny jokes that made me laugh but I didn't really find Eddie's weird obsession for shoes funny, like was it supposed to be funny? Guess it was meant to be humor but well... it was almost tiring.",Neutral
806,"A solid enough send off for this 'Venom' trilogy.'Venom: The Last Dance' is decently amusing and produces enough entertainment with its plot. I didn't personally find it overly funny, though the person a few seats across from me had an absolute blast - never a bad thing seeing people enjoy themselves!Tom Hardy remains the key element of these films, they would be far less enjoyable without his presence. There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor stick out most from the other characters.",Negative

808,"Being Rated R probably would have saved this; I am just saying!This trilogy-capper almost makes me question if I have become more of a movie critic than a movie enjoyer. Then I remembered this is Sony's Spider-Man Universe we are talking about, which gave us films like ""Morbius"" and ""Madame Web."" I nonetheless went in here with an open mind, considering I do not mind the two previous ""Venom"" films that came out. After seeing ""The Last Dance,"" I question whether Sony was trying to set up their universe or give Eddie Brock and Venom the send-off they deserve. I am sadly leaning more toward the former.I should preface this review by telling you what I thought of the other two ""Venom"" films upon rewatch in preparation for this third installment. Those were entertaining yet disappointing superhero films saved by the performance of Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and Venom. The first was innocent enough, with a dull first and more engaging second half, a weak villain in Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake/Riot, exciting action, and Hardy performing nicely. Its sequel, ""Let There Be Carnage,"" surprisingly got better when revisiting it, easily surpassing its predecessor, with Hardy allowed to stretch his comedic abilities with Brock and Venom bickering hilariously. In addition, there is Woody Harrelson's enjoyable performance as Cletus Kasady/Carnage, who manages to rise above the flaws, including the disappointing inclusion of Naomie Harris' Frances Barrison/Shriek. Hardy was allowed to have fun with his characters, and the movies complimented him with a narrative that was not too complicated. The opposite is true for ""The Last Dance.""Let's get the positives out of the way first. It is a short list, which I am deeply saddened by, but I want to show you how it is not the worst superhero film out there or even the worst film of the year.Despite a woeful screenplay, Tom Hardy still does skillfully with Eddie Brock and Venom. He is not allowed to have as much fun as he did in the prior two films, but he is trying his best (right, the positives. Sorry).The rest of the cast delivered equally solid performances, with the other standout being Chiwetel Ejiofor as Orwell Taylor. Ejiofor always has a commanding presence whenever he is in a movie, with his characters of Baron Mordo in the two ""Doctor Strange"" films and Bathurst 2020 in the forgettable ""Infinite"" being the two I can think of at the top of my head. Even if the film is not the best, Ejiofor makes it work, and if it is fantastic, he always steals the show.The visual effects bring Venom and the other alien characters to gorgeous life. The other two ""Venom"" movies, granted, had remarkable CGI, but it is worth mentioning, specifically when discussing the positives.The action is somewhat fun. The ""Venom"" movies have always had enjoyable action. Unfortunately, ""The Last Dance"" was the least fun action-wise, but the first scene with action was sweet.The Venom symbiote is sometimes uniquely utilized. The trailers showcased Venom controlling a horse, and in the film, it is one of its best scenes. I am unsure if this is a spoiler, but he controls other animals, and they introduce other symbiotes, which is fun.I think that is it for the positives.I felt the portrayal of Eddie Brock and Venom this time was not good. Again, Hardy tried, but there were multiple times when it felt like he was bored. His character was, admittedly, bored at intervals, and Hardy is a screenwriter, but I am saying how it felt.The film tries to add new characters, but they are not compelling. The most obvious example is Dr. Payne, played by Juno Temple, who does nothing aside from believing that Brock is not a danger, while Ejiofor wants what is best for the world, considering the alien threat from Knull.Speaking of Knull, he was worse than Carlton Drake. He only sends alien minions to grab a MacGuffin that Venom has. I have not read the comics, but the impression I get from others and this movie is that Knull has a profound lore not represented here. Having Knull's alien pals and the Area 51 agents as the villains is too much, yet somehow too little.They also wasted Stephen Graham's Detective Mulligan. The trailers made it seem like Mulligan would be a principal and intriguing character. The only two interesting aspects about Mulligan are he has a symbiote and warns of Knull. That is it.Furthermore, it does not have that much comedy. ""Let There Be Carnage"" can easily be classified as a comedy, and I laughed more than I would like to admit. I think two laughs and three to five chuckles were all I had here. The film was not funny outside of the Venom horse and some banter between Brock and Venom.On top of that, there was not that much emotion. It is due to how much Brock and Venom were not well utilized and the clutter of characters. I did not care about the Area 51 personnel nor the unnamed family who brought Brock and Venom to Vegas. When the ending came along, which heightened the stakes to an unbelievable degree, I did not get emotional. It tried, but it failed to work.The other two ""Venom"" movies were entertaining, but this failed to come close. In an era where ""superhero fatigue"" is becoming more accepted, this trilogy-closer did not try anything new. Fascinating concepts here and there, and many standout scenes fail to save this disappointment in a franchise filled with them.Technically, a 6/10. Outside of the plot and the underwhelming screenplay, the visual effects remain exceptional, the actors did great, and the film functions.For the enjoyment score, I wanted to like this film. I had the sneaking suspicion that it might not work, but watching ""Let There Be Carnage"" increase in quality gave me hope. It was no ""Let There Be Carnage"" and is easily the weakest of the trilogy. It had the issues that plagued the likes of ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but does not come close to being as entertaining as them. I am so unhappy that the enjoyment score is a 4/10, but this trilogy deserved a better conclusion. Maybe it will get better when I watch it again, but as it stands, it is best for me to recommend you wait until Netflix or even Disney+.",Positive
809,"This movie was very middle of the road to me. Definitely better than the second one, but not as good as the original.I enjoyed the beginning very much. Nice pace, good story and funny at times. Also the last part was packed with action and it all looked amazing. Only thing I missed was some sort of a climax at the very end.The middle however, I did not care for too much. Some things felt forced, rushed and very unlikely. But as I often say in my reviews: 'It is a fictional, fantasy, action movie so who cares if some things do not add up.'As a whole I enjoyed it very much, Tom Hardy did not disappoint.",Positive
810,"I just don't get it, I thought the 1st Venom was good despite many fans may not have liked it. I'm not a comic fan, so for me it was good that they try to make it as relatable and realistic to just your average movie goer.The 2nd film was cringy and terrible in my opinion because the story didn't make much sense, too much drama, poetry, and bromance. I lost interest after watching that one but the trailer for this film looked good.Right from the beginning I realize this was going to be bad. I don't care about the multi-verse, I don't care about Knull, I don't care about all these comic lores. The story is completely unrelatable and the suspension of disbelief failed early on.And then to top it off, the ending was just awful.4/10 for the special effects. Everything else is a 0.",Negative
811,"If you've already come to terms with this version of Venom and Eddie Brock as more of a bromance than the savage, brutal duo from the comics, you're in for a fun ride, Venom: The Last Dance, the final chapter of the trilogy, delivers an entertaining ride with solid pacing, good performances, decent visual effects, and fun engaging enough story, added also with the joy of let all the madness fan service out makes Venom: The Last Dance an easy good time especially for me, even the serious part mostly with Chiwetel Ejiofor was executed pretty well, surprising wholesome moments with Rhys Ifans and his family characters, flawed? Sure, some of the editing cuts didn't quite work for me, there were a few cheesy, awkward moments that felt off, and nit picky here and there, overall, i have a good time with Venom: The Last Dance, and the most surprising thing also the least thing i could expect watching this supposed to be last time we'll see both Venom and Eddie was that i did get quite emotional at the end, it's clear they've evolved from mere host and symbiote to something much deeper, and their dynamic was surprisingly touching, my personal experience with these two also comes as long as these three movies together, and as the movie itself whether it's better than the first one which also a good movie in my opinion, The Last Dance succeeded my expectation from being far from bad, i want this goodbye to be at least watchable enough, and the result is more than that, Venom: The Last Dance is actually a good film, just like Venom would say, We are Venom, and this film makes sure we feel it.",Negative
812,"Fun, wild, and hot mess. There's too much plot that's never explained. Events just happen randomly with no payoff, with a big action scene towards the end. Eddie & Venom Bromance is the savior of this trilogy. If you enjoy the others you will enjoy this.Synopsis:
In Venom: The Last Dance, Tom Hardy returns as Venom, one of Marvel's greatest and most complex characters, for the final film in the trilogy. Eddie and Venom are on the run. Hunted by both of their worlds and with the net closing in, the duo are forced into a devastating decision that will bring the curtains down on Venom and Eddie's last dance.",Positive
813,"If you were hoping for a grand finale to the Venom franchise that would surpass the comedic heights of its predecessors, you're in for a letdown. While Venom: The Last Dance does deliver on the comedic front, it falls short in nearly every other aspect.The film picks up right where we left off, with Eddie Brock and Venom still on the run. The plot takes a convoluted turn as they become embroiled in a government conspiracy involving symbiotes and a dangerous threat to the universe. While the premise is intriguing, the execution feels rushed and often confusing.The real draw of this film, as with its predecessors, is the chemistry between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom. Their banter and witty exchanges provide much-needed humor and keep the film entertaining. However, the comedic elements can feel forced at times, and the overall tone can be uneven.The film's biggest flaw is its reliance on poor CGI and even worse dialogue. The visual effects, particularly those involving the titular symbiote, often feel like a step back from previous entries. Venom's appearances are fleeting, and when he does appear in full form, he's often overshadowed by lackluster animation.The script is equally disappointing. The story lacks depth and originality, and the characters feel one-dimensional. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the pacing feels uneven. While there are a few moments of humor that might elicit a chuckle, they're not enough to salvage the film.Ultimately, Venom: The Last Dance is a missed opportunity. It's a shame that such a potentially fun franchise has ended on such a sour note.",Negative
814,"If cinematic catastrophes could have a mascot, this would be standing at the front of the line, waving its tattered flag of mediocrity. Tom Hardy's final outing as Eddie Brock/Venom is not just a disappointment-it's an insult to audiences everywhere. To call this movie bad would be a kindness. This is an incoherent, muddled, and utterly joyless mess that somehow manages to fall short of even the lowest expectations.The premise of Eddie and Venom being ""on the run"" from both worlds promised at least some thrilling action. Instead, what we get is a chaotic, poorly-scripted nightmare of disjointed scenes and absurd plot holes big enough to swallow the entire Marvel universe. The narrative, if you can call it that, lurches forward with all the grace of a drunken man stumbling in the dark. There is no rhyme or reason to the events that unfold. It's like the writers cobbled together every half-baked idea they could think of and hoped nobody would notice how little sense any of it makes.The so-called ""devastating decision"" that Eddie and Venom face feels less like a culmination of their journey and more like a cheap, hollow ploy to yank on the audience's emotions. But even that attempt falls flat because, by the time it arrives, the viewer is too exhausted from enduring 90 minutes of mindless drivel to care.Eddie Brock, once a complex and conflicted anti-hero from the source comics, is reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self, mumbling and stumbling through the film like he just wants to get it over with.The supporting characters are even worse-if that's possible. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use cardboard cutouts of side characters nobody cares about and clearly has no understanding of what made the earlier films (barely) work.They serve no purpose other than to waste screen time and remind us that, yes, someone actually wrote this drivel down on paper.It wouldn't be a Venom movie without over-the-top CGI battles, right? Well, unfortunately, the action scenes here are so poorly executed and short to save cost that even those who came purely for mindless entertainment will leave disappointed. The special effects are a headache-inducing blur of dark, indistinguishable shapes smashing into each other, with zero sense of tension or creativity.The final fight scene feels like -an unintelligible swirl of chaos that is supposed to distract us from the fact that nothing of consequence is happening. It's not exciting, it's not entertaining, it's just ugly.At its core it tries to sell itself as a dramatic, emotional farewell to Eddie and Venom's bond, but it doesn't even come close to achieving that. Any attempt at emotional weight is drowned by the film's clumsy pacing and complete lack of character development. The so-called ""devastating"" decision feels unearned, forced, and utterly unconvincing. There is no sense of closure, no satisfying payoff-just a hollow, empty finale that leaves you wondering why you wasted your time in the first place.Avoid this movie like the symbiote plague it is. Eddie and Venom deserved better. We all deserved better.Tom's ego and nepotism to promote his FWB director both of whom had sole credit of writing the script should tell you that how much he actually despises the franchise.Tom was the ultimate culprit is giving the first movie it's comic tone and had heated arguments with Ruben Flesicher on set to such an extent that filming halted for a few days. There were 3 script writers on the first movie can you guess who was one of them?It's the director of this movie who with her relationship strong armed and hijacked the plot elements and forced to introduce the comic tone into the first movie by reshooting the movie which had resulted in a disjointed mess.Even the Ruben had expressed his deep regrets about that but I guess if you can control the leading star you can have your way.If you closely look at the tone of the first movie first trailer you will notice the horror and science fiction elements present which had been stripped down to barebones and gag and quips reigned supreme.",Negative
815,"My wife and I watched Venom: The Last Dance (2024) last night in theaters. The storyline follows Eddie Brock, who is on the run from the law and hiding in Mexico. When an invasion from Venom's home world begins, Eddie must make his way to Area 51 to find reinforcements and fight off the invaders.Directed by Kelly Marcel in her directorial debut, the film stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Rhys Ifans (The Amazing Spider-Man), Stephen Graham (Snatch), and Juno Temple (Killer Joe).I absolutely loved the first two-thirds of this film. Tom Hardy nailed his role, bringing a perfect blend of humor, action, and Venom's signature appetite for chaos. The various forms Venom takes are visually entertaining, and the self-deprecating humor is spot-on. We especially enjoyed the introduction of a quirky ""hippie family,"" who added a fun twist. However, once the story shifts to Area 51, things feel rushed and forced. The other symbiotes look incredible, but they come and go so quickly that you're left wanting more. The villain's defeat also felt underwhelming, and I wanted a bit more depth in their storyline. The homage at the end felt somewhat awkward as well.In conclusion, Venom: The Last Dance is a fun watch and definitely worth seeing for fans of the character, though it doesn't quite reach its full potential. I'd rate it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Positive

817,"Venom 3 is fun movie. It will never be critically rated, but it doesn't need or try to be. It is fun, it is weird, it looks good and the interactions between Eddie and Venom are great as always and are funny unlike the forced jokes that don't always land. We get to see a bit more of the rest of the symbiotes, but it is not a major focus of the movie to introduce or highlight them, which was a bit disappointing personally. The storyline is a bit messy, and there are a few plotholes and illogical, unexplainable events, but the movie does a good job of actually taking the viewers through it. We get and ending to the trilogy that is pretty much what you expect, but the emotional charge of it feels a bit forced and doesn't let the viewer appreciate it for themselves. We also get a glimpse of what may come in the future, including a namedrop that comic fans will get, so we may see more of our goofy antihero in the future.",Positive
818,"Venom The Last Dance was hilarious, emotional and entertaining. Went in with the same expectations as before very low. I'm shocked about the critics, cause they expected much more unreal scenarios. Here again Sony is not stupid of course they'd have added a specific character in their world, but they probably can't because of a certain contract clause. The third movie is much better than the second cause the second movie suffered from extreme cuts which took out all its potential. Despite the fact that Venom was rumored and in productions ever since early 00s it's no wonder they made a trilogy and had box office success, cause Tom Hardy carried those movies on his own. Every other actor wouldn't be able to pull out this great chemistry between him and Venom. I'm not biased I see its flaws and weaknesses, but my God some critics thrashed this movie as if it's another Morbius or Madame Web. It's by far a better movie.The road trip family was adorable not necessary but there to add a more family atmosphere and emotional touch to this film. Juno Temple was good but underperformed and here background story was dragged into this movie.Ms Cheng was probably the best positive highlight of the movie besides the love for dogs and animals in general.A lot of great symbionts and designs were actually great to watch. I can't say much more to that point cause I want to avoid spoilers.The issuesThe plot and goal of the movie is clear but gets lost through the movie. The action sequences and CGI were average at best. I know that sounds awful for a higher rating, but hear me out. The cast was decent and some actors really shined here.Another problem is the camera work here too many fast cuts hardly to see specially when I think I was obligated to watch it in 3D. I prefer 2D.The biggest problem was there is no clear 1 v 1 villain here with heart and intentions. We have Knull as the big bad in the background but barely seen but only to bait us fans to watch it and another mystery character from the army or swat like crew not shown at all. Where as the first two movies had clear antagonists shown.Issue / or averageThe Ending was emotional and impactful with rushed bangs, but man there were some scenes I really felt touched by it. I still think they could've done more and Tom deserved more !I give it 6 but as a trilogy part and the Tom Hardy factor a light 7, cause reviews between 1-4 stars are harsh. And yeah don't leave there are two important post credit scenes. I'm really looking forward !",Positive

820,"Barely emotional. Barely funny. Barely mediocre. From this pattern, it can be deducted that Venom: The Last Dance is a passable movie that doesn't do enough right to feel like an epic send off, or do anything inherently wrong to be worth complaining about. It's just fine.Tom Hardy is once again the easy stand-out as Eddie Brock, using the same janky physical actions as Venom manipulates his movements to an entertaining degree. The humour is the same safe but fine lines of dialogue that either evoke a chuckle or short exhale of breath. The action scenes escalate in levels of excitement throughout the film, with the final act especially delivering some really fun mayhem. And being the supposed final film of the trilogy, there are some surprisingly tender moments sprinkled in, but aren't frequent enough to draw any real emotion.As aforementioned, the humour is fine but there's one particular segment of the film in Las Vegas that feels too ridiculous and reckless in the context of the movie. Moreover, the story sets up rules that either get contradicted, forgotten, or straight up ignored for the sake of 'cool' scenes. Aside from Eddie and Venom, the rest of the cast of characters come off as either underutilised, underdeveloped, or unnecessary. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rhys Ifans feel criminally wasted, Juno Temple and Clark Backo undermine each other as their characters could've been just compiled into one due to their similar traits, and Stephen Graham and Peggy Lu don't do much to feel properly utilised, especially Graham, who's character felt like was building up to a bigger pay-off than what we got. And the antagonist Knull was so sidelined that there's not much more to say about him other than 'he was in the movie'.In conclusion, for what Venom: The Last Dance can't deliver in a concise plot or compelling side characters, it manages to make up for it with fun symbiote action and mostly entertaining and semi-heartfelt sequences.",Negative
821,"Sony should publicly apologise to the audience for making this worst movie and make the audience suffer and wasted their time. So boring story, nothing to appreciate only actor (Tom Hardy) has done, good acting Else, everyone, not done anything to discuss, that's why am giving one star.Don't waste your money by going into the theatres. CGI was good, but story was so pathetic. You can just guess the whole picture by trailer waste of money. Tom Hardy should try superhero movies with other Studios sony is not good with superheroes. We have already seen this with Superman. Middle part was so boring and ending was too predictable.",Negative
822,"Venom: The Last Dance delivers exactly what it promises-an absurdly fun, high-octane ride with a surprising amount of heart. If you expected Avengers: Endgame level of finality, you walked into the wrong theater, but for those who wanted a dumb but entertaining alien-human bromance, this one's for you.This film is easily the best in the trilogy, blending sharp pacing, humor that actually lands, and action sequences that never feel forced. The weird yet charming dynamic between Eddie and Venom is in full swing, and the filmmakers know exactly how to tap into the ridiculous yet endearing relationship that has become the backbone of this series. It's self-aware without feeling desperate for laughs, striking a balance that's tough to nail in superhero movies these days.While some of the gore pushes the limits of PG-13, it's never gratuitous. There's enough bite to the violence to keep you hooked, but it stops short of being overwhelming. If anything, it adds a little edge to an otherwise slick, polished blockbuster.But the real kicker here is that, amidst all the chaos, Venom: The Last Dance sneaks in some genuine emotion. It's a film about keeping your best bro close, and somehow that works. So why all the hate? It's a popcorn flick that knows exactly what it is, and honestly, that's rare these days.",Positive
823,Almost the whole cast was full. The only cast members that helped was the family and of course the store lady. Mulligan was boring . I felt there was a power struggle when writing this. One wanted to show ase strong women yet made them look stupied and to emotional; while the other smart men but utterly useless in the long run causing more havoc and not thinking before moving.The CGI are as ok. The one creatures could have been way way more creative for sure.Over all it's a lack luster film unfortunately 😕..there's so much they could have done with Tom and this story line. We needed a version of him and Spider man yet have been robbed of that.,Negative
824,"First and foremost, it felt like the makers made every poor decision possible when it came to the sound tracks and music. That which is supposed to amplify the intensity of ride simply let it remain bland throughout, even the climax, even the falling action.With Venom and Eddie having largely ceased their bickering, their bromance has dwindled significantly in this movie. Being the conclusional piece of this hilarious trilogy, it has fallen short of many expectations.Of course there was some of those promised action as witnessed in the trailers. But was there something which swept me off my feet which was absent from the trailers? Not really.While the villain's back-story is rather solid, it could have been more centre-stage. Most of the characters that have made appearance in this movie felt weakly woven together; though the plot could not have moved forward without their roles, they barely left any impact. Speaking of the plot, it largely remains uneventful, with the makers just throwing a few name-sake 3D effect villainous creatures at our faces. There is only one major action sequence throughout the film, that it low-key has bottled down to something I would either skim through, or watch at a slightly increased playback speed.If the unnecessary scenes, and by that I mean, 'adding no humor or value to the plot' scenes were deleted, it could easily boil down to half its current run-time. That being said, there could definitely be leads from where this movie has left loose ends at, but presently, it stays far aloof from being involved in such a gifting.I feel like the last of the trilogy has not done justice to the previous two movies, it almost feels like watching a different character. The ending in particular came off to me as a tryhard terrific ending, and even if the clips were good, the track choices really did not work out for me.",Negative
825,"Eddie and Venom are on the run as fugitives after their battle with Carnage. They are chased by military force and aliens that want to capture them for their codex to unleash a greater evil in their world. Eddie and Venom venture out for a while avoiding authorities and the alien species.I am a fan of the first Venom movie. It is not a well-made movie, but it is so entertaining because of Tom Hardy's crazy performance in both roles and the wacky humor throughout the film. The second movie is much better made mainly because of Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris, but I actually enjoyed the first one more on a fun level. I was pretty excited for the third film and the trailers had me hooked. Does this trilogy end on a memorable last dance?I have mixed thoughts on Venom: The Last Dance. Let's start with the good. I love Eddie and Venom's dynamic and they are at their best in this movie. They have fun chemistry and banter and it feels like they are finally starting to get along with each other a bit better. They also have a few emotional moments that can come off as cheesy, but they have charm especially one scene where Eddie reassures Martin's son that his alien friend is there to help and Venom thanks the kid for a piece of chocolate. In a movie filled with silly moments and action-packed battles, it is a really sweet moment that shows how heroic Eddie and Venom have become.It helps that Tom Hardy is an absolute joy to watch. Hardy relishes in both of his roles and he never lets up. There are several moments of him doing stuff like going crazy at the slot machine and creating a drink at the bar by himself in a quick way. He also handles the more dramatic scenes very well making the more emotional moments work better than they should have.Also, Venom is a very cool character here. He is funny, his powers are awesome and he does anything to protect Eddie even knowing that if they are both alive the aliens will track them down because they have a codex. Venom's antics are very endearing and it seems like he just wants to join the fun and even tries to get Eddie to join in. I love watching him take control of other animals such as a horse, a fish and a frog. Venom is so much fun to watch and he is a good reason why I enjoy these movies despite their faults.The humor is for the most part pretty good. There is one gag that I cringed at but other than that, I got several laughs out of this movie. The banter between Eddie and Venom never gets old for me.The action scenes are pretty entertaining. The chase scene in the river is a standout because it looks cool, it has Eddie Brock defend himself without Venom and Venom turning into other creatures. It is also frenetic and fun to see play out. The climax is also big full of cool moments, but it is a little CGI heavy. However, it features Venom on a motorcycle again and it looks great. Overall, I enjoyed the action.The cinematography by Fabian Wagner is solid and colorful. The lighting is also on point with all of the scenes being lit well enough to see while having some flare in the shots. This is by far the best looking Venom movie filmmaking wise. The special effects are more polished and the alien creatures chasing Venom and Eddie look very menacing. Honestly, they kind of remind me of the Kaijus from Pacific Rim and I like that. There also other symbiotes in the film and they look very cool with their designs, but some of their colors blend in. The visuals are not perfect, but they are an upgrade from the last two movies.All that said, there are a few problems I have with this movie. The biggest problem is that the script is overstuffed. I know that there needs to other plot lines to have the story come together, but some of them do not work at all. The scientists subplot is one of the most boring parts of the movie with how slowly paced it is and how the tone shifts from fun to dreary and not the good kind of dreary. The subplot with Martin and his family is okay and has some great moments, but it can drag a little too long.The supporting cast does not hold a candle to Tom Hardy. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Rex Strickland is the best supporting performance, but his character is too unlikable to root for. Dr. Payne is kind of there until the climax. Clark Backo as Sadie Christmas is alright and she does a lot in the climax, but her character does not stand out until then. Rhys Ifans is having a lot of fun in his role as a family man who believes in aliens. While his family may have gotten a little more focus than they should have, Ifans is pretty fun to watch at times. Andy Serkis as Knull is absolutely wasted. He seems like a menacing villain, but he gets little to do aside from getting expository dialogue. By far, the weakest link in the film and wastes Andy Serkis on a limited role.The tone is all over the place. There are moments where this movie acts like a cheesy road trip comedy with Eddie and Venom and then the next scene could be overly serious research about the symbiotes. The movie progressively darker as it goes along and it has some moments that should come off as emotional and while they kind of work because of Tom Hardy's performance and the duo's likability, they feel a bit unearned because of how comedic this series is by now. When Eddie and Venom ponder the life they could have had when in the car with Martin's family, it is hard to feel anything because they have been two goofballs most of the time. Without spoiling anything, ending is a mixed bag for me because it is sad, but not a tearjerker like the movie wants it to be.The musical score by Dan Deacon makes no impression on me. It just sounds like generic music from any other movie. The needle drops are okay, but I wish they could find another song than Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. However, the credits song One Last Dance by Tom and Roman Morello and Grandson is really catchy and a great song to end the movie. Also, Maroon 5's Memories has a great needle drop here.Venom: The Last Dance is an entertaining movie. It is not well-made and not even as fun as the first film, but I overall had a pretty good time with the movie despite the many issues it has. I guess I cannot help but find Eddie and Venom a lot of fun to watch. Director Kelly Marcel did a great job with the scenes with those two and with the action scenes, but I think she bit off more than she could chew with the other subplots. If you like the Venom movies, you will probably enjoy this movie but if you never them then this movie will not change your mind.Stay through all of the credits.",Positive
826,"It is genuinely impressive that Sony managed to make the most mediocre trilogy ever with such an iconic character.In terms of enjoyment, Eddie and Venom continue to be a delightfully fun duo. In this 3rd movie, they are basically on a road trip and that was relatively entertaining for the most part. The final act of the movie was also a pretty enjoyable CGI action fest with some emotional scenes.However, the story and script are still as flat as ever. The narrative feels very half baked with it feeling like a chain of things just randomly happening. Pointless characters that don't add much. Jokes being thrown at you just to see which land. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor characters could have been played by anyone but feels purposely done because they knew fans recognised them from other Marvel projects. The villain Knull looks cool but is just there to be teased for future projects.Overall, it is better than the second film but just on par with the first. It is a mediocre final entry. Sony continues to disappoint with their universe and We all know Venom is coming back somehow. I do worry for Spiderman 4 and hope Sony don't mess that movie in anyway.",Neutral
827,"""Venom: The Last Dance' is a messy buddy road trip in which you must turn your brains off...again.Is it perfect? Nah, far from it. I think there are way too many storylines in here, and the main one got some potential, but it was wasted in typical Sony fashion. The ""Spider-Man 4"" rumors have been blown out of proportion in my opinion, so temper your expectations.The duo between Eddie and Venom is as fun as always. I mean Tom Hardy and the banter between them...I'm sorry, the banter between Hardy and himself is the best part of these movies (Hardy is doing the voice of Venom).The humor is there, but can't say I laughed all that much, beacause most of the jokes are base level childish again. It must be a bit more emotional as a whole, because supposedly is the last time we see Venom (hardly doubt), but it ends up kinda hollow.Knull is there...I guess, but will see how and when they'll use him again...it's Sony after all.It's a popcorn movie that reminds me of the early 2000's comic book movies. The action in the third act is good for the most parts and there are some funny moments here and there. Are there plot holes and some issues with the story? Yes. It's just another ""Turn your brains off"" Sony movie again.There are two credit scenes, first one is kinda important, the second one not so much.",Positive
828,"My relationship with the Venom franchise has been rocky. I have a soft spot for the first one, absolutely loathe the second, and now we come to the trilogy's closer, and thankfully, it's an improvement.Venom: The Last Dance works best when it focuses on Eddie and Venom's story instead of trying to set up the future of the Sonyverse. If you didn't like the previous Venom films, this won't change your mind. It's still messy, but it gets more right than its predecessors.This is easily the campiest and most mature of the bunch. It takes its time with the characters, letting us sit with them instead of rushing into the next action set piece. Still being PG-13 it manages to cram in a lot more gore than its predecessors. The action is inventive, and the humor hits its mark. It also doesn't shy away from getting personal and emotional. Eddie and Venom's relationship has never felt more genuine. I'll admit-I teared up a few times by the end.Some may be disappointed by the potrayal of Knull, but personally, I loved it. He feels like an overlooming threat rather than an one-off villain, and the ""God of Darkness"" gets a Thanos-esque treatment he deserves.Now, don't get me wrong-the movie is still bad, technically speaking-but it's self-aware about that. Instead of being ""bad bad,"" it chooses to be ""fun bad"" and entertain you, and I respect that. Not every movie needs to be great; sometimes being fun is enough.Even with the lows, I have always found a weird sense of comfort with this rendition of Venom. I have found myself caring more for these characters than maybe even the script intended. So I am happy to say that by the end, it does enough to justify this trilogy's existence - and to such an satisfying extent that I'd rather live in a world where the Venom movies exist than one where it doesn't.",Positive
829,"The third installment about the symbiotic anti-hero is a mix of bright moments and disappointments. Tom Hardy once again proves why he is the perfect choice for the role of Eddie Brock/Venom, but even his charismatic performance cannot save the unbalanced ensemble. The film starts off promisingly - with dynamic action and witty dialogue between Eddie and his symbiotic companion. Their relationship is still the best the series has to offer. Hardy brilliantly manages both comedic timing and dramatic moments. The visual effects are impressive in places, especially in the action sequences where Venom shows off his abilities. At other times, however, the CGI feels inadequate and more reminiscent of a video game from the last decade. Some fights are well choreographed, others are a chaotic mix of digital effects. The biggest problem is the script, which tries to be too ambitious. It mixes several storylines, introduces new characters and antagonists, but does not give them enough space to develop. The result is a rushed pace and superficial characters. The film's darker tone is a welcome change, but it often clashes with the comedic elements, creating an unbalanced whole. The film seems unsure whether it wants to be a serious drama or a lighthearted entertainment. Venom: The Last Dance is like a roller coaster - it's ups and downs. For fans of the series, it offers enough fun, but it's hard to call it a significant step forward. This film is like an average song on a great album, but as a whole it doesn't leave a strong impression. Fans will find their own, others may be disappointed.",Positive
830,"Maybe it's just because of my low expectations toward the series but it was just fun to watch. I've already lost hope for the trilogy to have a decent plot but I can say that this one has a better storyline than the second film.CGI was fine, I coudn't find any disturbing point. It was interesting to see the other symbiotes. I think those new symbiotes showed more symbiote-ish action scenes than venom when it comes to the fight ironically.There were a few funny jokes that made me laugh but I didn't really find Eddie's weird obsession for shoes funny, like was it supposed to be funny? Guess it was meant to be humor but well... it was almost tiring.",Neutral
831,"A solid enough send off for this 'Venom' trilogy.'Venom: The Last Dance' is decently amusing and produces enough entertainment with its plot. I didn't personally find it overly funny, though the person a few seats across from me had an absolute blast - never a bad thing seeing people enjoy themselves!Tom Hardy remains the key element of these films, they would be far less enjoyable without his presence. There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor stick out most from the other characters.",Negative

833,"Being Rated R probably would have saved this; I am just saying!This trilogy-capper almost makes me question if I have become more of a movie critic than a movie enjoyer. Then I remembered this is Sony's Spider-Man Universe we are talking about, which gave us films like ""Morbius"" and ""Madame Web."" I nonetheless went in here with an open mind, considering I do not mind the two previous ""Venom"" films that came out. After seeing ""The Last Dance,"" I question whether Sony was trying to set up their universe or give Eddie Brock and Venom the send-off they deserve. I am sadly leaning more toward the former.I should preface this review by telling you what I thought of the other two ""Venom"" films upon rewatch in preparation for this third installment. Those were entertaining yet disappointing superhero films saved by the performance of Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and Venom. The first was innocent enough, with a dull first and more engaging second half, a weak villain in Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake/Riot, exciting action, and Hardy performing nicely. Its sequel, ""Let There Be Carnage,"" surprisingly got better when revisiting it, easily surpassing its predecessor, with Hardy allowed to stretch his comedic abilities with Brock and Venom bickering hilariously. In addition, there is Woody Harrelson's enjoyable performance as Cletus Kasady/Carnage, who manages to rise above the flaws, including the disappointing inclusion of Naomie Harris' Frances Barrison/Shriek. Hardy was allowed to have fun with his characters, and the movies complimented him with a narrative that was not too complicated. The opposite is true for ""The Last Dance.""Let's get the positives out of the way first. It is a short list, which I am deeply saddened by, but I want to show you how it is not the worst superhero film out there or even the worst film of the year.Despite a woeful screenplay, Tom Hardy still does skillfully with Eddie Brock and Venom. He is not allowed to have as much fun as he did in the prior two films, but he is trying his best (right, the positives. Sorry).The rest of the cast delivered equally solid performances, with the other standout being Chiwetel Ejiofor as Orwell Taylor. Ejiofor always has a commanding presence whenever he is in a movie, with his characters of Baron Mordo in the two ""Doctor Strange"" films and Bathurst 2020 in the forgettable ""Infinite"" being the two I can think of at the top of my head. Even if the film is not the best, Ejiofor makes it work, and if it is fantastic, he always steals the show.The visual effects bring Venom and the other alien characters to gorgeous life. The other two ""Venom"" movies, granted, had remarkable CGI, but it is worth mentioning, specifically when discussing the positives.The action is somewhat fun. The ""Venom"" movies have always had enjoyable action. Unfortunately, ""The Last Dance"" was the least fun action-wise, but the first scene with action was sweet.The Venom symbiote is sometimes uniquely utilized. The trailers showcased Venom controlling a horse, and in the film, it is one of its best scenes. I am unsure if this is a spoiler, but he controls other animals, and they introduce other symbiotes, which is fun.I think that is it for the positives.I felt the portrayal of Eddie Brock and Venom this time was not good. Again, Hardy tried, but there were multiple times when it felt like he was bored. His character was, admittedly, bored at intervals, and Hardy is a screenwriter, but I am saying how it felt.The film tries to add new characters, but they are not compelling. The most obvious example is Dr. Payne, played by Juno Temple, who does nothing aside from believing that Brock is not a danger, while Ejiofor wants what is best for the world, considering the alien threat from Knull.Speaking of Knull, he was worse than Carlton Drake. He only sends alien minions to grab a MacGuffin that Venom has. I have not read the comics, but the impression I get from others and this movie is that Knull has a profound lore not represented here. Having Knull's alien pals and the Area 51 agents as the villains is too much, yet somehow too little.They also wasted Stephen Graham's Detective Mulligan. The trailers made it seem like Mulligan would be a principal and intriguing character. The only two interesting aspects about Mulligan are he has a symbiote and warns of Knull. That is it.Furthermore, it does not have that much comedy. ""Let There Be Carnage"" can easily be classified as a comedy, and I laughed more than I would like to admit. I think two laughs and three to five chuckles were all I had here. The film was not funny outside of the Venom horse and some banter between Brock and Venom.On top of that, there was not that much emotion. It is due to how much Brock and Venom were not well utilized and the clutter of characters. I did not care about the Area 51 personnel nor the unnamed family who brought Brock and Venom to Vegas. When the ending came along, which heightened the stakes to an unbelievable degree, I did not get emotional. It tried, but it failed to work.The other two ""Venom"" movies were entertaining, but this failed to come close. In an era where ""superhero fatigue"" is becoming more accepted, this trilogy-closer did not try anything new. Fascinating concepts here and there, and many standout scenes fail to save this disappointment in a franchise filled with them.Technically, a 6/10. Outside of the plot and the underwhelming screenplay, the visual effects remain exceptional, the actors did great, and the film functions.For the enjoyment score, I wanted to like this film. I had the sneaking suspicion that it might not work, but watching ""Let There Be Carnage"" increase in quality gave me hope. It was no ""Let There Be Carnage"" and is easily the weakest of the trilogy. It had the issues that plagued the likes of ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but does not come close to being as entertaining as them. I am so unhappy that the enjoyment score is a 4/10, but this trilogy deserved a better conclusion. Maybe it will get better when I watch it again, but as it stands, it is best for me to recommend you wait until Netflix or even Disney+.",Positive
834,"This movie was very middle of the road to me. Definitely better than the second one, but not as good as the original.I enjoyed the beginning very much. Nice pace, good story and funny at times. Also the last part was packed with action and it all looked amazing. Only thing I missed was some sort of a climax at the very end.The middle however, I did not care for too much. Some things felt forced, rushed and very unlikely. But as I often say in my reviews: 'It is a fictional, fantasy, action movie so who cares if some things do not add up.'As a whole I enjoyed it very much, Tom Hardy did not disappoint.",Positive
835,"I just don't get it, I thought the 1st Venom was good despite many fans may not have liked it. I'm not a comic fan, so for me it was good that they try to make it as relatable and realistic to just your average movie goer.The 2nd film was cringy and terrible in my opinion because the story didn't make much sense, too much drama, poetry, and bromance. I lost interest after watching that one but the trailer for this film looked good.Right from the beginning I realize this was going to be bad. I don't care about the multi-verse, I don't care about Knull, I don't care about all these comic lores. The story is completely unrelatable and the suspension of disbelief failed early on.And then to top it off, the ending was just awful.4/10 for the special effects. Everything else is a 0.",Negative
836,"If you've already come to terms with this version of Venom and Eddie Brock as more of a bromance than the savage, brutal duo from the comics, you're in for a fun ride, Venom: The Last Dance, the final chapter of the trilogy, delivers an entertaining ride with solid pacing, good performances, decent visual effects, and fun engaging enough story, added also with the joy of let all the madness fan service out makes Venom: The Last Dance an easy good time especially for me, even the serious part mostly with Chiwetel Ejiofor was executed pretty well, surprising wholesome moments with Rhys Ifans and his family characters, flawed? Sure, some of the editing cuts didn't quite work for me, there were a few cheesy, awkward moments that felt off, and nit picky here and there, overall, i have a good time with Venom: The Last Dance, and the most surprising thing also the least thing i could expect watching this supposed to be last time we'll see both Venom and Eddie was that i did get quite emotional at the end, it's clear they've evolved from mere host and symbiote to something much deeper, and their dynamic was surprisingly touching, my personal experience with these two also comes as long as these three movies together, and as the movie itself whether it's better than the first one which also a good movie in my opinion, The Last Dance succeeded my expectation from being far from bad, i want this goodbye to be at least watchable enough, and the result is more than that, Venom: The Last Dance is actually a good film, just like Venom would say, We are Venom, and this film makes sure we feel it.",Negative
837,"Fun, wild, and hot mess. There's too much plot that's never explained. Events just happen randomly with no payoff, with a big action scene towards the end. Eddie & Venom Bromance is the savior of this trilogy. If you enjoy the others you will enjoy this.Synopsis:
In Venom: The Last Dance, Tom Hardy returns as Venom, one of Marvel's greatest and most complex characters, for the final film in the trilogy. Eddie and Venom are on the run. Hunted by both of their worlds and with the net closing in, the duo are forced into a devastating decision that will bring the curtains down on Venom and Eddie's last dance.",Positive
838,"If you were hoping for a grand finale to the Venom franchise that would surpass the comedic heights of its predecessors, you're in for a letdown. While Venom: The Last Dance does deliver on the comedic front, it falls short in nearly every other aspect.The film picks up right where we left off, with Eddie Brock and Venom still on the run. The plot takes a convoluted turn as they become embroiled in a government conspiracy involving symbiotes and a dangerous threat to the universe. While the premise is intriguing, the execution feels rushed and often confusing.The real draw of this film, as with its predecessors, is the chemistry between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom. Their banter and witty exchanges provide much-needed humor and keep the film entertaining. However, the comedic elements can feel forced at times, and the overall tone can be uneven.The film's biggest flaw is its reliance on poor CGI and even worse dialogue. The visual effects, particularly those involving the titular symbiote, often feel like a step back from previous entries. Venom's appearances are fleeting, and when he does appear in full form, he's often overshadowed by lackluster animation.The script is equally disappointing. The story lacks depth and originality, and the characters feel one-dimensional. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the pacing feels uneven. While there are a few moments of humor that might elicit a chuckle, they're not enough to salvage the film.Ultimately, Venom: The Last Dance is a missed opportunity. It's a shame that such a potentially fun franchise has ended on such a sour note.",Negative
839,"If cinematic catastrophes could have a mascot, this would be standing at the front of the line, waving its tattered flag of mediocrity. Tom Hardy's final outing as Eddie Brock/Venom is not just a disappointment-it's an insult to audiences everywhere. To call this movie bad would be a kindness. This is an incoherent, muddled, and utterly joyless mess that somehow manages to fall short of even the lowest expectations.The premise of Eddie and Venom being ""on the run"" from both worlds promised at least some thrilling action. Instead, what we get is a chaotic, poorly-scripted nightmare of disjointed scenes and absurd plot holes big enough to swallow the entire Marvel universe. The narrative, if you can call it that, lurches forward with all the grace of a drunken man stumbling in the dark. There is no rhyme or reason to the events that unfold. It's like the writers cobbled together every half-baked idea they could think of and hoped nobody would notice how little sense any of it makes.The so-called ""devastating decision"" that Eddie and Venom face feels less like a culmination of their journey and more like a cheap, hollow ploy to yank on the audience's emotions. But even that attempt falls flat because, by the time it arrives, the viewer is too exhausted from enduring 90 minutes of mindless drivel to care.Eddie Brock, once a complex and conflicted anti-hero from the source comics, is reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self, mumbling and stumbling through the film like he just wants to get it over with.The supporting characters are even worse-if that's possible. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use cardboard cutouts of side characters nobody cares about and clearly has no understanding of what made the earlier films (barely) work.They serve no purpose other than to waste screen time and remind us that, yes, someone actually wrote this drivel down on paper.It wouldn't be a Venom movie without over-the-top CGI battles, right? Well, unfortunately, the action scenes here are so poorly executed and short to save cost that even those who came purely for mindless entertainment will leave disappointed. The special effects are a headache-inducing blur of dark, indistinguishable shapes smashing into each other, with zero sense of tension or creativity.The final fight scene feels like -an unintelligible swirl of chaos that is supposed to distract us from the fact that nothing of consequence is happening. It's not exciting, it's not entertaining, it's just ugly.At its core it tries to sell itself as a dramatic, emotional farewell to Eddie and Venom's bond, but it doesn't even come close to achieving that. Any attempt at emotional weight is drowned by the film's clumsy pacing and complete lack of character development. The so-called ""devastating"" decision feels unearned, forced, and utterly unconvincing. There is no sense of closure, no satisfying payoff-just a hollow, empty finale that leaves you wondering why you wasted your time in the first place.Avoid this movie like the symbiote plague it is. Eddie and Venom deserved better. We all deserved better.Tom's ego and nepotism to promote his FWB director both of whom had sole credit of writing the script should tell you that how much he actually despises the franchise.Tom was the ultimate culprit is giving the first movie it's comic tone and had heated arguments with Ruben Flesicher on set to such an extent that filming halted for a few days. There were 3 script writers on the first movie can you guess who was one of them?It's the director of this movie who with her relationship strong armed and hijacked the plot elements and forced to introduce the comic tone into the first movie by reshooting the movie which had resulted in a disjointed mess.Even the Ruben had expressed his deep regrets about that but I guess if you can control the leading star you can have your way.If you closely look at the tone of the first movie first trailer you will notice the horror and science fiction elements present which had been stripped down to barebones and gag and quips reigned supreme.",Negative
840,"My wife and I watched Venom: The Last Dance (2024) last night in theaters. The storyline follows Eddie Brock, who is on the run from the law and hiding in Mexico. When an invasion from Venom's home world begins, Eddie must make his way to Area 51 to find reinforcements and fight off the invaders.Directed by Kelly Marcel in her directorial debut, the film stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Rhys Ifans (The Amazing Spider-Man), Stephen Graham (Snatch), and Juno Temple (Killer Joe).I absolutely loved the first two-thirds of this film. Tom Hardy nailed his role, bringing a perfect blend of humor, action, and Venom's signature appetite for chaos. The various forms Venom takes are visually entertaining, and the self-deprecating humor is spot-on. We especially enjoyed the introduction of a quirky ""hippie family,"" who added a fun twist. However, once the story shifts to Area 51, things feel rushed and forced. The other symbiotes look incredible, but they come and go so quickly that you're left wanting more. The villain's defeat also felt underwhelming, and I wanted a bit more depth in their storyline. The homage at the end felt somewhat awkward as well.In conclusion, Venom: The Last Dance is a fun watch and definitely worth seeing for fans of the character, though it doesn't quite reach its full potential. I'd rate it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Positive

842,"Venom 3 is fun movie. It will never be critically rated, but it doesn't need or try to be. It is fun, it is weird, it looks good and the interactions between Eddie and Venom are great as always and are funny unlike the forced jokes that don't always land. We get to see a bit more of the rest of the symbiotes, but it is not a major focus of the movie to introduce or highlight them, which was a bit disappointing personally. The storyline is a bit messy, and there are a few plotholes and illogical, unexplainable events, but the movie does a good job of actually taking the viewers through it. We get and ending to the trilogy that is pretty much what you expect, but the emotional charge of it feels a bit forced and doesn't let the viewer appreciate it for themselves. We also get a glimpse of what may come in the future, including a namedrop that comic fans will get, so we may see more of our goofy antihero in the future.",Positive
843,"Venom The Last Dance was hilarious, emotional and entertaining. Went in with the same expectations as before very low. I'm shocked about the critics, cause they expected much more unreal scenarios. Here again Sony is not stupid of course they'd have added a specific character in their world, but they probably can't because of a certain contract clause. The third movie is much better than the second cause the second movie suffered from extreme cuts which took out all its potential. Despite the fact that Venom was rumored and in productions ever since early 00s it's no wonder they made a trilogy and had box office success, cause Tom Hardy carried those movies on his own. Every other actor wouldn't be able to pull out this great chemistry between him and Venom. I'm not biased I see its flaws and weaknesses, but my God some critics thrashed this movie as if it's another Morbius or Madame Web. It's by far a better movie.The road trip family was adorable not necessary but there to add a more family atmosphere and emotional touch to this film. Juno Temple was good but underperformed and here background story was dragged into this movie.Ms Cheng was probably the best positive highlight of the movie besides the love for dogs and animals in general.A lot of great symbionts and designs were actually great to watch. I can't say much more to that point cause I want to avoid spoilers.The issuesThe plot and goal of the movie is clear but gets lost through the movie. The action sequences and CGI were average at best. I know that sounds awful for a higher rating, but hear me out. The cast was decent and some actors really shined here.Another problem is the camera work here too many fast cuts hardly to see specially when I think I was obligated to watch it in 3D. I prefer 2D.The biggest problem was there is no clear 1 v 1 villain here with heart and intentions. We have Knull as the big bad in the background but barely seen but only to bait us fans to watch it and another mystery character from the army or swat like crew not shown at all. Where as the first two movies had clear antagonists shown.Issue / or averageThe Ending was emotional and impactful with rushed bangs, but man there were some scenes I really felt touched by it. I still think they could've done more and Tom deserved more !I give it 6 but as a trilogy part and the Tom Hardy factor a light 7, cause reviews between 1-4 stars are harsh. And yeah don't leave there are two important post credit scenes. I'm really looking forward !",Positive

845,"Barely emotional. Barely funny. Barely mediocre. From this pattern, it can be deducted that Venom: The Last Dance is a passable movie that doesn't do enough right to feel like an epic send off, or do anything inherently wrong to be worth complaining about. It's just fine.Tom Hardy is once again the easy stand-out as Eddie Brock, using the same janky physical actions as Venom manipulates his movements to an entertaining degree. The humour is the same safe but fine lines of dialogue that either evoke a chuckle or short exhale of breath. The action scenes escalate in levels of excitement throughout the film, with the final act especially delivering some really fun mayhem. And being the supposed final film of the trilogy, there are some surprisingly tender moments sprinkled in, but aren't frequent enough to draw any real emotion.As aforementioned, the humour is fine but there's one particular segment of the film in Las Vegas that feels too ridiculous and reckless in the context of the movie. Moreover, the story sets up rules that either get contradicted, forgotten, or straight up ignored for the sake of 'cool' scenes. Aside from Eddie and Venom, the rest of the cast of characters come off as either underutilised, underdeveloped, or unnecessary. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rhys Ifans feel criminally wasted, Juno Temple and Clark Backo undermine each other as their characters could've been just compiled into one due to their similar traits, and Stephen Graham and Peggy Lu don't do much to feel properly utilised, especially Graham, who's character felt like was building up to a bigger pay-off than what we got. And the antagonist Knull was so sidelined that there's not much more to say about him other than 'he was in the movie'.In conclusion, for what Venom: The Last Dance can't deliver in a concise plot or compelling side characters, it manages to make up for it with fun symbiote action and mostly entertaining and semi-heartfelt sequences.",Negative
846,"Sony should publicly apologise to the audience for making this worst movie and make the audience suffer and wasted their time. So boring story, nothing to appreciate only actor (Tom Hardy) has done, good acting Else, everyone, not done anything to discuss, that's why am giving one star.Don't waste your money by going into the theatres. CGI was good, but story was so pathetic. You can just guess the whole picture by trailer waste of money. Tom Hardy should try superhero movies with other Studios sony is not good with superheroes. We have already seen this with Superman. Middle part was so boring and ending was too predictable.",Negative
847,"Venom: The Last Dance delivers exactly what it promises-an absurdly fun, high-octane ride with a surprising amount of heart. If you expected Avengers: Endgame level of finality, you walked into the wrong theater, but for those who wanted a dumb but entertaining alien-human bromance, this one's for you.This film is easily the best in the trilogy, blending sharp pacing, humor that actually lands, and action sequences that never feel forced. The weird yet charming dynamic between Eddie and Venom is in full swing, and the filmmakers know exactly how to tap into the ridiculous yet endearing relationship that has become the backbone of this series. It's self-aware without feeling desperate for laughs, striking a balance that's tough to nail in superhero movies these days.While some of the gore pushes the limits of PG-13, it's never gratuitous. There's enough bite to the violence to keep you hooked, but it stops short of being overwhelming. If anything, it adds a little edge to an otherwise slick, polished blockbuster.But the real kicker here is that, amidst all the chaos, Venom: The Last Dance sneaks in some genuine emotion. It's a film about keeping your best bro close, and somehow that works. So why all the hate? It's a popcorn flick that knows exactly what it is, and honestly, that's rare these days.",Positive
848,Almost the whole cast was full. The only cast members that helped was the family and of course the store lady. Mulligan was boring . I felt there was a power struggle when writing this. One wanted to show ase strong women yet made them look stupied and to emotional; while the other smart men but utterly useless in the long run causing more havoc and not thinking before moving.The CGI are as ok. The one creatures could have been way way more creative for sure.Over all it's a lack luster film unfortunately 😕..there's so much they could have done with Tom and this story line. We needed a version of him and Spider man yet have been robbed of that.,Negative
849,"First and foremost, it felt like the makers made every poor decision possible when it came to the sound tracks and music. That which is supposed to amplify the intensity of ride simply let it remain bland throughout, even the climax, even the falling action.With Venom and Eddie having largely ceased their bickering, their bromance has dwindled significantly in this movie. Being the conclusional piece of this hilarious trilogy, it has fallen short of many expectations.Of course there was some of those promised action as witnessed in the trailers. But was there something which swept me off my feet which was absent from the trailers? Not really.While the villain's back-story is rather solid, it could have been more centre-stage. Most of the characters that have made appearance in this movie felt weakly woven together; though the plot could not have moved forward without their roles, they barely left any impact. Speaking of the plot, it largely remains uneventful, with the makers just throwing a few name-sake 3D effect villainous creatures at our faces. There is only one major action sequence throughout the film, that it low-key has bottled down to something I would either skim through, or watch at a slightly increased playback speed.If the unnecessary scenes, and by that I mean, 'adding no humor or value to the plot' scenes were deleted, it could easily boil down to half its current run-time. That being said, there could definitely be leads from where this movie has left loose ends at, but presently, it stays far aloof from being involved in such a gifting.I feel like the last of the trilogy has not done justice to the previous two movies, it almost feels like watching a different character. The ending in particular came off to me as a tryhard terrific ending, and even if the clips were good, the track choices really did not work out for me.",Negative
850,"Eddie and Venom are on the run as fugitives after their battle with Carnage. They are chased by military force and aliens that want to capture them for their codex to unleash a greater evil in their world. Eddie and Venom venture out for a while avoiding authorities and the alien species.I am a fan of the first Venom movie. It is not a well-made movie, but it is so entertaining because of Tom Hardy's crazy performance in both roles and the wacky humor throughout the film. The second movie is much better made mainly because of Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris, but I actually enjoyed the first one more on a fun level. I was pretty excited for the third film and the trailers had me hooked. Does this trilogy end on a memorable last dance?I have mixed thoughts on Venom: The Last Dance. Let's start with the good. I love Eddie and Venom's dynamic and they are at their best in this movie. They have fun chemistry and banter and it feels like they are finally starting to get along with each other a bit better. They also have a few emotional moments that can come off as cheesy, but they have charm especially one scene where Eddie reassures Martin's son that his alien friend is there to help and Venom thanks the kid for a piece of chocolate. In a movie filled with silly moments and action-packed battles, it is a really sweet moment that shows how heroic Eddie and Venom have become.It helps that Tom Hardy is an absolute joy to watch. Hardy relishes in both of his roles and he never lets up. There are several moments of him doing stuff like going crazy at the slot machine and creating a drink at the bar by himself in a quick way. He also handles the more dramatic scenes very well making the more emotional moments work better than they should have.Also, Venom is a very cool character here. He is funny, his powers are awesome and he does anything to protect Eddie even knowing that if they are both alive the aliens will track them down because they have a codex. Venom's antics are very endearing and it seems like he just wants to join the fun and even tries to get Eddie to join in. I love watching him take control of other animals such as a horse, a fish and a frog. Venom is so much fun to watch and he is a good reason why I enjoy these movies despite their faults.The humor is for the most part pretty good. There is one gag that I cringed at but other than that, I got several laughs out of this movie. The banter between Eddie and Venom never gets old for me.The action scenes are pretty entertaining. The chase scene in the river is a standout because it looks cool, it has Eddie Brock defend himself without Venom and Venom turning into other creatures. It is also frenetic and fun to see play out. The climax is also big full of cool moments, but it is a little CGI heavy. However, it features Venom on a motorcycle again and it looks great. Overall, I enjoyed the action.The cinematography by Fabian Wagner is solid and colorful. The lighting is also on point with all of the scenes being lit well enough to see while having some flare in the shots. This is by far the best looking Venom movie filmmaking wise. The special effects are more polished and the alien creatures chasing Venom and Eddie look very menacing. Honestly, they kind of remind me of the Kaijus from Pacific Rim and I like that. There also other symbiotes in the film and they look very cool with their designs, but some of their colors blend in. The visuals are not perfect, but they are an upgrade from the last two movies.All that said, there are a few problems I have with this movie. The biggest problem is that the script is overstuffed. I know that there needs to other plot lines to have the story come together, but some of them do not work at all. The scientists subplot is one of the most boring parts of the movie with how slowly paced it is and how the tone shifts from fun to dreary and not the good kind of dreary. The subplot with Martin and his family is okay and has some great moments, but it can drag a little too long.The supporting cast does not hold a candle to Tom Hardy. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Rex Strickland is the best supporting performance, but his character is too unlikable to root for. Dr. Payne is kind of there until the climax. Clark Backo as Sadie Christmas is alright and she does a lot in the climax, but her character does not stand out until then. Rhys Ifans is having a lot of fun in his role as a family man who believes in aliens. While his family may have gotten a little more focus than they should have, Ifans is pretty fun to watch at times. Andy Serkis as Knull is absolutely wasted. He seems like a menacing villain, but he gets little to do aside from getting expository dialogue. By far, the weakest link in the film and wastes Andy Serkis on a limited role.The tone is all over the place. There are moments where this movie acts like a cheesy road trip comedy with Eddie and Venom and then the next scene could be overly serious research about the symbiotes. The movie progressively darker as it goes along and it has some moments that should come off as emotional and while they kind of work because of Tom Hardy's performance and the duo's likability, they feel a bit unearned because of how comedic this series is by now. When Eddie and Venom ponder the life they could have had when in the car with Martin's family, it is hard to feel anything because they have been two goofballs most of the time. Without spoiling anything, ending is a mixed bag for me because it is sad, but not a tearjerker like the movie wants it to be.The musical score by Dan Deacon makes no impression on me. It just sounds like generic music from any other movie. The needle drops are okay, but I wish they could find another song than Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. However, the credits song One Last Dance by Tom and Roman Morello and Grandson is really catchy and a great song to end the movie. Also, Maroon 5's Memories has a great needle drop here.Venom: The Last Dance is an entertaining movie. It is not well-made and not even as fun as the first film, but I overall had a pretty good time with the movie despite the many issues it has. I guess I cannot help but find Eddie and Venom a lot of fun to watch. Director Kelly Marcel did a great job with the scenes with those two and with the action scenes, but I think she bit off more than she could chew with the other subplots. If you like the Venom movies, you will probably enjoy this movie but if you never them then this movie will not change your mind.Stay through all of the credits.",Positive
851,"It is genuinely impressive that Sony managed to make the most mediocre trilogy ever with such an iconic character.In terms of enjoyment, Eddie and Venom continue to be a delightfully fun duo. In this 3rd movie, they are basically on a road trip and that was relatively entertaining for the most part. The final act of the movie was also a pretty enjoyable CGI action fest with some emotional scenes.However, the story and script are still as flat as ever. The narrative feels very half baked with it feeling like a chain of things just randomly happening. Pointless characters that don't add much. Jokes being thrown at you just to see which land. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor characters could have been played by anyone but feels purposely done because they knew fans recognised them from other Marvel projects. The villain Knull looks cool but is just there to be teased for future projects.Overall, it is better than the second film but just on par with the first. It is a mediocre final entry. Sony continues to disappoint with their universe and We all know Venom is coming back somehow. I do worry for Spiderman 4 and hope Sony don't mess that movie in anyway.",Neutral
852,"""Venom: The Last Dance' is a messy buddy road trip in which you must turn your brains off...again.Is it perfect? Nah, far from it. I think there are way too many storylines in here, and the main one got some potential, but it was wasted in typical Sony fashion. The ""Spider-Man 4"" rumors have been blown out of proportion in my opinion, so temper your expectations.The duo between Eddie and Venom is as fun as always. I mean Tom Hardy and the banter between them...I'm sorry, the banter between Hardy and himself is the best part of these movies (Hardy is doing the voice of Venom).The humor is there, but can't say I laughed all that much, beacause most of the jokes are base level childish again. It must be a bit more emotional as a whole, because supposedly is the last time we see Venom (hardly doubt), but it ends up kinda hollow.Knull is there...I guess, but will see how and when they'll use him again...it's Sony after all.It's a popcorn movie that reminds me of the early 2000's comic book movies. The action in the third act is good for the most parts and there are some funny moments here and there. Are there plot holes and some issues with the story? Yes. It's just another ""Turn your brains off"" Sony movie again.There are two credit scenes, first one is kinda important, the second one not so much.",Positive
853,"My relationship with the Venom franchise has been rocky. I have a soft spot for the first one, absolutely loathe the second, and now we come to the trilogy's closer, and thankfully, it's an improvement.Venom: The Last Dance works best when it focuses on Eddie and Venom's story instead of trying to set up the future of the Sonyverse. If you didn't like the previous Venom films, this won't change your mind. It's still messy, but it gets more right than its predecessors.This is easily the campiest and most mature of the bunch. It takes its time with the characters, letting us sit with them instead of rushing into the next action set piece. Still being PG-13 it manages to cram in a lot more gore than its predecessors. The action is inventive, and the humor hits its mark. It also doesn't shy away from getting personal and emotional. Eddie and Venom's relationship has never felt more genuine. I'll admit-I teared up a few times by the end.Some may be disappointed by the potrayal of Knull, but personally, I loved it. He feels like an overlooming threat rather than an one-off villain, and the ""God of Darkness"" gets a Thanos-esque treatment he deserves.Now, don't get me wrong-the movie is still bad, technically speaking-but it's self-aware about that. Instead of being ""bad bad,"" it chooses to be ""fun bad"" and entertain you, and I respect that. Not every movie needs to be great; sometimes being fun is enough.Even with the lows, I have always found a weird sense of comfort with this rendition of Venom. I have found myself caring more for these characters than maybe even the script intended. So I am happy to say that by the end, it does enough to justify this trilogy's existence - and to such an satisfying extent that I'd rather live in a world where the Venom movies exist than one where it doesn't.",Positive
854,"The third installment about the symbiotic anti-hero is a mix of bright moments and disappointments. Tom Hardy once again proves why he is the perfect choice for the role of Eddie Brock/Venom, but even his charismatic performance cannot save the unbalanced ensemble. The film starts off promisingly - with dynamic action and witty dialogue between Eddie and his symbiotic companion. Their relationship is still the best the series has to offer. Hardy brilliantly manages both comedic timing and dramatic moments. The visual effects are impressive in places, especially in the action sequences where Venom shows off his abilities. At other times, however, the CGI feels inadequate and more reminiscent of a video game from the last decade. Some fights are well choreographed, others are a chaotic mix of digital effects. The biggest problem is the script, which tries to be too ambitious. It mixes several storylines, introduces new characters and antagonists, but does not give them enough space to develop. The result is a rushed pace and superficial characters. The film's darker tone is a welcome change, but it often clashes with the comedic elements, creating an unbalanced whole. The film seems unsure whether it wants to be a serious drama or a lighthearted entertainment. Venom: The Last Dance is like a roller coaster - it's ups and downs. For fans of the series, it offers enough fun, but it's hard to call it a significant step forward. This film is like an average song on a great album, but as a whole it doesn't leave a strong impression. Fans will find their own, others may be disappointed.",Positive
855,"Maybe it's just because of my low expectations toward the series but it was just fun to watch. I've already lost hope for the trilogy to have a decent plot but I can say that this one has a better storyline than the second film.CGI was fine, I coudn't find any disturbing point. It was interesting to see the other symbiotes. I think those new symbiotes showed more symbiote-ish action scenes than venom when it comes to the fight ironically.There were a few funny jokes that made me laugh but I didn't really find Eddie's weird obsession for shoes funny, like was it supposed to be funny? Guess it was meant to be humor but well... it was almost tiring.",Neutral
856,"A solid enough send off for this 'Venom' trilogy.'Venom: The Last Dance' is decently amusing and produces enough entertainment with its plot. I didn't personally find it overly funny, though the person a few seats across from me had an absolute blast - never a bad thing seeing people enjoy themselves!Tom Hardy remains the key element of these films, they would be far less enjoyable without his presence. There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor stick out most from the other characters.",Negative

858,"Being Rated R probably would have saved this; I am just saying!This trilogy-capper almost makes me question if I have become more of a movie critic than a movie enjoyer. Then I remembered this is Sony's Spider-Man Universe we are talking about, which gave us films like ""Morbius"" and ""Madame Web."" I nonetheless went in here with an open mind, considering I do not mind the two previous ""Venom"" films that came out. After seeing ""The Last Dance,"" I question whether Sony was trying to set up their universe or give Eddie Brock and Venom the send-off they deserve. I am sadly leaning more toward the former.I should preface this review by telling you what I thought of the other two ""Venom"" films upon rewatch in preparation for this third installment. Those were entertaining yet disappointing superhero films saved by the performance of Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and Venom. The first was innocent enough, with a dull first and more engaging second half, a weak villain in Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake/Riot, exciting action, and Hardy performing nicely. Its sequel, ""Let There Be Carnage,"" surprisingly got better when revisiting it, easily surpassing its predecessor, with Hardy allowed to stretch his comedic abilities with Brock and Venom bickering hilariously. In addition, there is Woody Harrelson's enjoyable performance as Cletus Kasady/Carnage, who manages to rise above the flaws, including the disappointing inclusion of Naomie Harris' Frances Barrison/Shriek. Hardy was allowed to have fun with his characters, and the movies complimented him with a narrative that was not too complicated. The opposite is true for ""The Last Dance.""Let's get the positives out of the way first. It is a short list, which I am deeply saddened by, but I want to show you how it is not the worst superhero film out there or even the worst film of the year.Despite a woeful screenplay, Tom Hardy still does skillfully with Eddie Brock and Venom. He is not allowed to have as much fun as he did in the prior two films, but he is trying his best (right, the positives. Sorry).The rest of the cast delivered equally solid performances, with the other standout being Chiwetel Ejiofor as Orwell Taylor. Ejiofor always has a commanding presence whenever he is in a movie, with his characters of Baron Mordo in the two ""Doctor Strange"" films and Bathurst 2020 in the forgettable ""Infinite"" being the two I can think of at the top of my head. Even if the film is not the best, Ejiofor makes it work, and if it is fantastic, he always steals the show.The visual effects bring Venom and the other alien characters to gorgeous life. The other two ""Venom"" movies, granted, had remarkable CGI, but it is worth mentioning, specifically when discussing the positives.The action is somewhat fun. The ""Venom"" movies have always had enjoyable action. Unfortunately, ""The Last Dance"" was the least fun action-wise, but the first scene with action was sweet.The Venom symbiote is sometimes uniquely utilized. The trailers showcased Venom controlling a horse, and in the film, it is one of its best scenes. I am unsure if this is a spoiler, but he controls other animals, and they introduce other symbiotes, which is fun.I think that is it for the positives.I felt the portrayal of Eddie Brock and Venom this time was not good. Again, Hardy tried, but there were multiple times when it felt like he was bored. His character was, admittedly, bored at intervals, and Hardy is a screenwriter, but I am saying how it felt.The film tries to add new characters, but they are not compelling. The most obvious example is Dr. Payne, played by Juno Temple, who does nothing aside from believing that Brock is not a danger, while Ejiofor wants what is best for the world, considering the alien threat from Knull.Speaking of Knull, he was worse than Carlton Drake. He only sends alien minions to grab a MacGuffin that Venom has. I have not read the comics, but the impression I get from others and this movie is that Knull has a profound lore not represented here. Having Knull's alien pals and the Area 51 agents as the villains is too much, yet somehow too little.They also wasted Stephen Graham's Detective Mulligan. The trailers made it seem like Mulligan would be a principal and intriguing character. The only two interesting aspects about Mulligan are he has a symbiote and warns of Knull. That is it.Furthermore, it does not have that much comedy. ""Let There Be Carnage"" can easily be classified as a comedy, and I laughed more than I would like to admit. I think two laughs and three to five chuckles were all I had here. The film was not funny outside of the Venom horse and some banter between Brock and Venom.On top of that, there was not that much emotion. It is due to how much Brock and Venom were not well utilized and the clutter of characters. I did not care about the Area 51 personnel nor the unnamed family who brought Brock and Venom to Vegas. When the ending came along, which heightened the stakes to an unbelievable degree, I did not get emotional. It tried, but it failed to work.The other two ""Venom"" movies were entertaining, but this failed to come close. In an era where ""superhero fatigue"" is becoming more accepted, this trilogy-closer did not try anything new. Fascinating concepts here and there, and many standout scenes fail to save this disappointment in a franchise filled with them.Technically, a 6/10. Outside of the plot and the underwhelming screenplay, the visual effects remain exceptional, the actors did great, and the film functions.For the enjoyment score, I wanted to like this film. I had the sneaking suspicion that it might not work, but watching ""Let There Be Carnage"" increase in quality gave me hope. It was no ""Let There Be Carnage"" and is easily the weakest of the trilogy. It had the issues that plagued the likes of ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but does not come close to being as entertaining as them. I am so unhappy that the enjoyment score is a 4/10, but this trilogy deserved a better conclusion. Maybe it will get better when I watch it again, but as it stands, it is best for me to recommend you wait until Netflix or even Disney+.",Positive
859,"This movie was very middle of the road to me. Definitely better than the second one, but not as good as the original.I enjoyed the beginning very much. Nice pace, good story and funny at times. Also the last part was packed with action and it all looked amazing. Only thing I missed was some sort of a climax at the very end.The middle however, I did not care for too much. Some things felt forced, rushed and very unlikely. But as I often say in my reviews: 'It is a fictional, fantasy, action movie so who cares if some things do not add up.'As a whole I enjoyed it very much, Tom Hardy did not disappoint.",Positive
860,"I just don't get it, I thought the 1st Venom was good despite many fans may not have liked it. I'm not a comic fan, so for me it was good that they try to make it as relatable and realistic to just your average movie goer.The 2nd film was cringy and terrible in my opinion because the story didn't make much sense, too much drama, poetry, and bromance. I lost interest after watching that one but the trailer for this film looked good.Right from the beginning I realize this was going to be bad. I don't care about the multi-verse, I don't care about Knull, I don't care about all these comic lores. The story is completely unrelatable and the suspension of disbelief failed early on.And then to top it off, the ending was just awful.4/10 for the special effects. Everything else is a 0.",Negative
861,"If you've already come to terms with this version of Venom and Eddie Brock as more of a bromance than the savage, brutal duo from the comics, you're in for a fun ride, Venom: The Last Dance, the final chapter of the trilogy, delivers an entertaining ride with solid pacing, good performances, decent visual effects, and fun engaging enough story, added also with the joy of let all the madness fan service out makes Venom: The Last Dance an easy good time especially for me, even the serious part mostly with Chiwetel Ejiofor was executed pretty well, surprising wholesome moments with Rhys Ifans and his family characters, flawed? Sure, some of the editing cuts didn't quite work for me, there were a few cheesy, awkward moments that felt off, and nit picky here and there, overall, i have a good time with Venom: The Last Dance, and the most surprising thing also the least thing i could expect watching this supposed to be last time we'll see both Venom and Eddie was that i did get quite emotional at the end, it's clear they've evolved from mere host and symbiote to something much deeper, and their dynamic was surprisingly touching, my personal experience with these two also comes as long as these three movies together, and as the movie itself whether it's better than the first one which also a good movie in my opinion, The Last Dance succeeded my expectation from being far from bad, i want this goodbye to be at least watchable enough, and the result is more than that, Venom: The Last Dance is actually a good film, just like Venom would say, We are Venom, and this film makes sure we feel it.",Negative
862,"Fun, wild, and hot mess. There's too much plot that's never explained. Events just happen randomly with no payoff, with a big action scene towards the end. Eddie & Venom Bromance is the savior of this trilogy. If you enjoy the others you will enjoy this.Synopsis:
In Venom: The Last Dance, Tom Hardy returns as Venom, one of Marvel's greatest and most complex characters, for the final film in the trilogy. Eddie and Venom are on the run. Hunted by both of their worlds and with the net closing in, the duo are forced into a devastating decision that will bring the curtains down on Venom and Eddie's last dance.",Positive
863,"If you were hoping for a grand finale to the Venom franchise that would surpass the comedic heights of its predecessors, you're in for a letdown. While Venom: The Last Dance does deliver on the comedic front, it falls short in nearly every other aspect.The film picks up right where we left off, with Eddie Brock and Venom still on the run. The plot takes a convoluted turn as they become embroiled in a government conspiracy involving symbiotes and a dangerous threat to the universe. While the premise is intriguing, the execution feels rushed and often confusing.The real draw of this film, as with its predecessors, is the chemistry between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom. Their banter and witty exchanges provide much-needed humor and keep the film entertaining. However, the comedic elements can feel forced at times, and the overall tone can be uneven.The film's biggest flaw is its reliance on poor CGI and even worse dialogue. The visual effects, particularly those involving the titular symbiote, often feel like a step back from previous entries. Venom's appearances are fleeting, and when he does appear in full form, he's often overshadowed by lackluster animation.The script is equally disappointing. The story lacks depth and originality, and the characters feel one-dimensional. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the pacing feels uneven. While there are a few moments of humor that might elicit a chuckle, they're not enough to salvage the film.Ultimately, Venom: The Last Dance is a missed opportunity. It's a shame that such a potentially fun franchise has ended on such a sour note.",Negative
864,"If cinematic catastrophes could have a mascot, this would be standing at the front of the line, waving its tattered flag of mediocrity. Tom Hardy's final outing as Eddie Brock/Venom is not just a disappointment-it's an insult to audiences everywhere. To call this movie bad would be a kindness. This is an incoherent, muddled, and utterly joyless mess that somehow manages to fall short of even the lowest expectations.The premise of Eddie and Venom being ""on the run"" from both worlds promised at least some thrilling action. Instead, what we get is a chaotic, poorly-scripted nightmare of disjointed scenes and absurd plot holes big enough to swallow the entire Marvel universe. The narrative, if you can call it that, lurches forward with all the grace of a drunken man stumbling in the dark. There is no rhyme or reason to the events that unfold. It's like the writers cobbled together every half-baked idea they could think of and hoped nobody would notice how little sense any of it makes.The so-called ""devastating decision"" that Eddie and Venom face feels less like a culmination of their journey and more like a cheap, hollow ploy to yank on the audience's emotions. But even that attempt falls flat because, by the time it arrives, the viewer is too exhausted from enduring 90 minutes of mindless drivel to care.Eddie Brock, once a complex and conflicted anti-hero from the source comics, is reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self, mumbling and stumbling through the film like he just wants to get it over with.The supporting characters are even worse-if that's possible. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use cardboard cutouts of side characters nobody cares about and clearly has no understanding of what made the earlier films (barely) work.They serve no purpose other than to waste screen time and remind us that, yes, someone actually wrote this drivel down on paper.It wouldn't be a Venom movie without over-the-top CGI battles, right? Well, unfortunately, the action scenes here are so poorly executed and short to save cost that even those who came purely for mindless entertainment will leave disappointed. The special effects are a headache-inducing blur of dark, indistinguishable shapes smashing into each other, with zero sense of tension or creativity.The final fight scene feels like -an unintelligible swirl of chaos that is supposed to distract us from the fact that nothing of consequence is happening. It's not exciting, it's not entertaining, it's just ugly.At its core it tries to sell itself as a dramatic, emotional farewell to Eddie and Venom's bond, but it doesn't even come close to achieving that. Any attempt at emotional weight is drowned by the film's clumsy pacing and complete lack of character development. The so-called ""devastating"" decision feels unearned, forced, and utterly unconvincing. There is no sense of closure, no satisfying payoff-just a hollow, empty finale that leaves you wondering why you wasted your time in the first place.Avoid this movie like the symbiote plague it is. Eddie and Venom deserved better. We all deserved better.Tom's ego and nepotism to promote his FWB director both of whom had sole credit of writing the script should tell you that how much he actually despises the franchise.Tom was the ultimate culprit is giving the first movie it's comic tone and had heated arguments with Ruben Flesicher on set to such an extent that filming halted for a few days. There were 3 script writers on the first movie can you guess who was one of them?It's the director of this movie who with her relationship strong armed and hijacked the plot elements and forced to introduce the comic tone into the first movie by reshooting the movie which had resulted in a disjointed mess.Even the Ruben had expressed his deep regrets about that but I guess if you can control the leading star you can have your way.If you closely look at the tone of the first movie first trailer you will notice the horror and science fiction elements present which had been stripped down to barebones and gag and quips reigned supreme.",Negative
865,"My wife and I watched Venom: The Last Dance (2024) last night in theaters. The storyline follows Eddie Brock, who is on the run from the law and hiding in Mexico. When an invasion from Venom's home world begins, Eddie must make his way to Area 51 to find reinforcements and fight off the invaders.Directed by Kelly Marcel in her directorial debut, the film stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Rhys Ifans (The Amazing Spider-Man), Stephen Graham (Snatch), and Juno Temple (Killer Joe).I absolutely loved the first two-thirds of this film. Tom Hardy nailed his role, bringing a perfect blend of humor, action, and Venom's signature appetite for chaos. The various forms Venom takes are visually entertaining, and the self-deprecating humor is spot-on. We especially enjoyed the introduction of a quirky ""hippie family,"" who added a fun twist. However, once the story shifts to Area 51, things feel rushed and forced. The other symbiotes look incredible, but they come and go so quickly that you're left wanting more. The villain's defeat also felt underwhelming, and I wanted a bit more depth in their storyline. The homage at the end felt somewhat awkward as well.In conclusion, Venom: The Last Dance is a fun watch and definitely worth seeing for fans of the character, though it doesn't quite reach its full potential. I'd rate it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Positive

867,"Venom 3 is fun movie. It will never be critically rated, but it doesn't need or try to be. It is fun, it is weird, it looks good and the interactions between Eddie and Venom are great as always and are funny unlike the forced jokes that don't always land. We get to see a bit more of the rest of the symbiotes, but it is not a major focus of the movie to introduce or highlight them, which was a bit disappointing personally. The storyline is a bit messy, and there are a few plotholes and illogical, unexplainable events, but the movie does a good job of actually taking the viewers through it. We get and ending to the trilogy that is pretty much what you expect, but the emotional charge of it feels a bit forced and doesn't let the viewer appreciate it for themselves. We also get a glimpse of what may come in the future, including a namedrop that comic fans will get, so we may see more of our goofy antihero in the future.",Positive
868,"Venom The Last Dance was hilarious, emotional and entertaining. Went in with the same expectations as before very low. I'm shocked about the critics, cause they expected much more unreal scenarios. Here again Sony is not stupid of course they'd have added a specific character in their world, but they probably can't because of a certain contract clause. The third movie is much better than the second cause the second movie suffered from extreme cuts which took out all its potential. Despite the fact that Venom was rumored and in productions ever since early 00s it's no wonder they made a trilogy and had box office success, cause Tom Hardy carried those movies on his own. Every other actor wouldn't be able to pull out this great chemistry between him and Venom. I'm not biased I see its flaws and weaknesses, but my God some critics thrashed this movie as if it's another Morbius or Madame Web. It's by far a better movie.The road trip family was adorable not necessary but there to add a more family atmosphere and emotional touch to this film. Juno Temple was good but underperformed and here background story was dragged into this movie.Ms Cheng was probably the best positive highlight of the movie besides the love for dogs and animals in general.A lot of great symbionts and designs were actually great to watch. I can't say much more to that point cause I want to avoid spoilers.The issuesThe plot and goal of the movie is clear but gets lost through the movie. The action sequences and CGI were average at best. I know that sounds awful for a higher rating, but hear me out. The cast was decent and some actors really shined here.Another problem is the camera work here too many fast cuts hardly to see specially when I think I was obligated to watch it in 3D. I prefer 2D.The biggest problem was there is no clear 1 v 1 villain here with heart and intentions. We have Knull as the big bad in the background but barely seen but only to bait us fans to watch it and another mystery character from the army or swat like crew not shown at all. Where as the first two movies had clear antagonists shown.Issue / or averageThe Ending was emotional and impactful with rushed bangs, but man there were some scenes I really felt touched by it. I still think they could've done more and Tom deserved more !I give it 6 but as a trilogy part and the Tom Hardy factor a light 7, cause reviews between 1-4 stars are harsh. And yeah don't leave there are two important post credit scenes. I'm really looking forward !",Positive

870,"Barely emotional. Barely funny. Barely mediocre. From this pattern, it can be deducted that Venom: The Last Dance is a passable movie that doesn't do enough right to feel like an epic send off, or do anything inherently wrong to be worth complaining about. It's just fine.Tom Hardy is once again the easy stand-out as Eddie Brock, using the same janky physical actions as Venom manipulates his movements to an entertaining degree. The humour is the same safe but fine lines of dialogue that either evoke a chuckle or short exhale of breath. The action scenes escalate in levels of excitement throughout the film, with the final act especially delivering some really fun mayhem. And being the supposed final film of the trilogy, there are some surprisingly tender moments sprinkled in, but aren't frequent enough to draw any real emotion.As aforementioned, the humour is fine but there's one particular segment of the film in Las Vegas that feels too ridiculous and reckless in the context of the movie. Moreover, the story sets up rules that either get contradicted, forgotten, or straight up ignored for the sake of 'cool' scenes. Aside from Eddie and Venom, the rest of the cast of characters come off as either underutilised, underdeveloped, or unnecessary. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rhys Ifans feel criminally wasted, Juno Temple and Clark Backo undermine each other as their characters could've been just compiled into one due to their similar traits, and Stephen Graham and Peggy Lu don't do much to feel properly utilised, especially Graham, who's character felt like was building up to a bigger pay-off than what we got. And the antagonist Knull was so sidelined that there's not much more to say about him other than 'he was in the movie'.In conclusion, for what Venom: The Last Dance can't deliver in a concise plot or compelling side characters, it manages to make up for it with fun symbiote action and mostly entertaining and semi-heartfelt sequences.",Negative
871,"Sony should publicly apologise to the audience for making this worst movie and make the audience suffer and wasted their time. So boring story, nothing to appreciate only actor (Tom Hardy) has done, good acting Else, everyone, not done anything to discuss, that's why am giving one star.Don't waste your money by going into the theatres. CGI was good, but story was so pathetic. You can just guess the whole picture by trailer waste of money. Tom Hardy should try superhero movies with other Studios sony is not good with superheroes. We have already seen this with Superman. Middle part was so boring and ending was too predictable.",Negative
872,"Venom: The Last Dance delivers exactly what it promises-an absurdly fun, high-octane ride with a surprising amount of heart. If you expected Avengers: Endgame level of finality, you walked into the wrong theater, but for those who wanted a dumb but entertaining alien-human bromance, this one's for you.This film is easily the best in the trilogy, blending sharp pacing, humor that actually lands, and action sequences that never feel forced. The weird yet charming dynamic between Eddie and Venom is in full swing, and the filmmakers know exactly how to tap into the ridiculous yet endearing relationship that has become the backbone of this series. It's self-aware without feeling desperate for laughs, striking a balance that's tough to nail in superhero movies these days.While some of the gore pushes the limits of PG-13, it's never gratuitous. There's enough bite to the violence to keep you hooked, but it stops short of being overwhelming. If anything, it adds a little edge to an otherwise slick, polished blockbuster.But the real kicker here is that, amidst all the chaos, Venom: The Last Dance sneaks in some genuine emotion. It's a film about keeping your best bro close, and somehow that works. So why all the hate? It's a popcorn flick that knows exactly what it is, and honestly, that's rare these days.",Positive
873,Almost the whole cast was full. The only cast members that helped was the family and of course the store lady. Mulligan was boring . I felt there was a power struggle when writing this. One wanted to show ase strong women yet made them look stupied and to emotional; while the other smart men but utterly useless in the long run causing more havoc and not thinking before moving.The CGI are as ok. The one creatures could have been way way more creative for sure.Over all it's a lack luster film unfortunately 😕..there's so much they could have done with Tom and this story line. We needed a version of him and Spider man yet have been robbed of that.,Negative
874,"First and foremost, it felt like the makers made every poor decision possible when it came to the sound tracks and music. That which is supposed to amplify the intensity of ride simply let it remain bland throughout, even the climax, even the falling action.With Venom and Eddie having largely ceased their bickering, their bromance has dwindled significantly in this movie. Being the conclusional piece of this hilarious trilogy, it has fallen short of many expectations.Of course there was some of those promised action as witnessed in the trailers. But was there something which swept me off my feet which was absent from the trailers? Not really.While the villain's back-story is rather solid, it could have been more centre-stage. Most of the characters that have made appearance in this movie felt weakly woven together; though the plot could not have moved forward without their roles, they barely left any impact. Speaking of the plot, it largely remains uneventful, with the makers just throwing a few name-sake 3D effect villainous creatures at our faces. There is only one major action sequence throughout the film, that it low-key has bottled down to something I would either skim through, or watch at a slightly increased playback speed.If the unnecessary scenes, and by that I mean, 'adding no humor or value to the plot' scenes were deleted, it could easily boil down to half its current run-time. That being said, there could definitely be leads from where this movie has left loose ends at, but presently, it stays far aloof from being involved in such a gifting.I feel like the last of the trilogy has not done justice to the previous two movies, it almost feels like watching a different character. The ending in particular came off to me as a tryhard terrific ending, and even if the clips were good, the track choices really did not work out for me.",Negative
875,"Eddie and Venom are on the run as fugitives after their battle with Carnage. They are chased by military force and aliens that want to capture them for their codex to unleash a greater evil in their world. Eddie and Venom venture out for a while avoiding authorities and the alien species.I am a fan of the first Venom movie. It is not a well-made movie, but it is so entertaining because of Tom Hardy's crazy performance in both roles and the wacky humor throughout the film. The second movie is much better made mainly because of Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris, but I actually enjoyed the first one more on a fun level. I was pretty excited for the third film and the trailers had me hooked. Does this trilogy end on a memorable last dance?I have mixed thoughts on Venom: The Last Dance. Let's start with the good. I love Eddie and Venom's dynamic and they are at their best in this movie. They have fun chemistry and banter and it feels like they are finally starting to get along with each other a bit better. They also have a few emotional moments that can come off as cheesy, but they have charm especially one scene where Eddie reassures Martin's son that his alien friend is there to help and Venom thanks the kid for a piece of chocolate. In a movie filled with silly moments and action-packed battles, it is a really sweet moment that shows how heroic Eddie and Venom have become.It helps that Tom Hardy is an absolute joy to watch. Hardy relishes in both of his roles and he never lets up. There are several moments of him doing stuff like going crazy at the slot machine and creating a drink at the bar by himself in a quick way. He also handles the more dramatic scenes very well making the more emotional moments work better than they should have.Also, Venom is a very cool character here. He is funny, his powers are awesome and he does anything to protect Eddie even knowing that if they are both alive the aliens will track them down because they have a codex. Venom's antics are very endearing and it seems like he just wants to join the fun and even tries to get Eddie to join in. I love watching him take control of other animals such as a horse, a fish and a frog. Venom is so much fun to watch and he is a good reason why I enjoy these movies despite their faults.The humor is for the most part pretty good. There is one gag that I cringed at but other than that, I got several laughs out of this movie. The banter between Eddie and Venom never gets old for me.The action scenes are pretty entertaining. The chase scene in the river is a standout because it looks cool, it has Eddie Brock defend himself without Venom and Venom turning into other creatures. It is also frenetic and fun to see play out. The climax is also big full of cool moments, but it is a little CGI heavy. However, it features Venom on a motorcycle again and it looks great. Overall, I enjoyed the action.The cinematography by Fabian Wagner is solid and colorful. The lighting is also on point with all of the scenes being lit well enough to see while having some flare in the shots. This is by far the best looking Venom movie filmmaking wise. The special effects are more polished and the alien creatures chasing Venom and Eddie look very menacing. Honestly, they kind of remind me of the Kaijus from Pacific Rim and I like that. There also other symbiotes in the film and they look very cool with their designs, but some of their colors blend in. The visuals are not perfect, but they are an upgrade from the last two movies.All that said, there are a few problems I have with this movie. The biggest problem is that the script is overstuffed. I know that there needs to other plot lines to have the story come together, but some of them do not work at all. The scientists subplot is one of the most boring parts of the movie with how slowly paced it is and how the tone shifts from fun to dreary and not the good kind of dreary. The subplot with Martin and his family is okay and has some great moments, but it can drag a little too long.The supporting cast does not hold a candle to Tom Hardy. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Rex Strickland is the best supporting performance, but his character is too unlikable to root for. Dr. Payne is kind of there until the climax. Clark Backo as Sadie Christmas is alright and she does a lot in the climax, but her character does not stand out until then. Rhys Ifans is having a lot of fun in his role as a family man who believes in aliens. While his family may have gotten a little more focus than they should have, Ifans is pretty fun to watch at times. Andy Serkis as Knull is absolutely wasted. He seems like a menacing villain, but he gets little to do aside from getting expository dialogue. By far, the weakest link in the film and wastes Andy Serkis on a limited role.The tone is all over the place. There are moments where this movie acts like a cheesy road trip comedy with Eddie and Venom and then the next scene could be overly serious research about the symbiotes. The movie progressively darker as it goes along and it has some moments that should come off as emotional and while they kind of work because of Tom Hardy's performance and the duo's likability, they feel a bit unearned because of how comedic this series is by now. When Eddie and Venom ponder the life they could have had when in the car with Martin's family, it is hard to feel anything because they have been two goofballs most of the time. Without spoiling anything, ending is a mixed bag for me because it is sad, but not a tearjerker like the movie wants it to be.The musical score by Dan Deacon makes no impression on me. It just sounds like generic music from any other movie. The needle drops are okay, but I wish they could find another song than Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. However, the credits song One Last Dance by Tom and Roman Morello and Grandson is really catchy and a great song to end the movie. Also, Maroon 5's Memories has a great needle drop here.Venom: The Last Dance is an entertaining movie. It is not well-made and not even as fun as the first film, but I overall had a pretty good time with the movie despite the many issues it has. I guess I cannot help but find Eddie and Venom a lot of fun to watch. Director Kelly Marcel did a great job with the scenes with those two and with the action scenes, but I think she bit off more than she could chew with the other subplots. If you like the Venom movies, you will probably enjoy this movie but if you never them then this movie will not change your mind.Stay through all of the credits.",Positive
876,"It is genuinely impressive that Sony managed to make the most mediocre trilogy ever with such an iconic character.In terms of enjoyment, Eddie and Venom continue to be a delightfully fun duo. In this 3rd movie, they are basically on a road trip and that was relatively entertaining for the most part. The final act of the movie was also a pretty enjoyable CGI action fest with some emotional scenes.However, the story and script are still as flat as ever. The narrative feels very half baked with it feeling like a chain of things just randomly happening. Pointless characters that don't add much. Jokes being thrown at you just to see which land. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor characters could have been played by anyone but feels purposely done because they knew fans recognised them from other Marvel projects. The villain Knull looks cool but is just there to be teased for future projects.Overall, it is better than the second film but just on par with the first. It is a mediocre final entry. Sony continues to disappoint with their universe and We all know Venom is coming back somehow. I do worry for Spiderman 4 and hope Sony don't mess that movie in anyway.",Neutral
877,"""Venom: The Last Dance' is a messy buddy road trip in which you must turn your brains off...again.Is it perfect? Nah, far from it. I think there are way too many storylines in here, and the main one got some potential, but it was wasted in typical Sony fashion. The ""Spider-Man 4"" rumors have been blown out of proportion in my opinion, so temper your expectations.The duo between Eddie and Venom is as fun as always. I mean Tom Hardy and the banter between them...I'm sorry, the banter between Hardy and himself is the best part of these movies (Hardy is doing the voice of Venom).The humor is there, but can't say I laughed all that much, beacause most of the jokes are base level childish again. It must be a bit more emotional as a whole, because supposedly is the last time we see Venom (hardly doubt), but it ends up kinda hollow.Knull is there...I guess, but will see how and when they'll use him again...it's Sony after all.It's a popcorn movie that reminds me of the early 2000's comic book movies. The action in the third act is good for the most parts and there are some funny moments here and there. Are there plot holes and some issues with the story? Yes. It's just another ""Turn your brains off"" Sony movie again.There are two credit scenes, first one is kinda important, the second one not so much.",Positive
878,"My relationship with the Venom franchise has been rocky. I have a soft spot for the first one, absolutely loathe the second, and now we come to the trilogy's closer, and thankfully, it's an improvement.Venom: The Last Dance works best when it focuses on Eddie and Venom's story instead of trying to set up the future of the Sonyverse. If you didn't like the previous Venom films, this won't change your mind. It's still messy, but it gets more right than its predecessors.This is easily the campiest and most mature of the bunch. It takes its time with the characters, letting us sit with them instead of rushing into the next action set piece. Still being PG-13 it manages to cram in a lot more gore than its predecessors. The action is inventive, and the humor hits its mark. It also doesn't shy away from getting personal and emotional. Eddie and Venom's relationship has never felt more genuine. I'll admit-I teared up a few times by the end.Some may be disappointed by the potrayal of Knull, but personally, I loved it. He feels like an overlooming threat rather than an one-off villain, and the ""God of Darkness"" gets a Thanos-esque treatment he deserves.Now, don't get me wrong-the movie is still bad, technically speaking-but it's self-aware about that. Instead of being ""bad bad,"" it chooses to be ""fun bad"" and entertain you, and I respect that. Not every movie needs to be great; sometimes being fun is enough.Even with the lows, I have always found a weird sense of comfort with this rendition of Venom. I have found myself caring more for these characters than maybe even the script intended. So I am happy to say that by the end, it does enough to justify this trilogy's existence - and to such an satisfying extent that I'd rather live in a world where the Venom movies exist than one where it doesn't.",Positive
879,"The third installment about the symbiotic anti-hero is a mix of bright moments and disappointments. Tom Hardy once again proves why he is the perfect choice for the role of Eddie Brock/Venom, but even his charismatic performance cannot save the unbalanced ensemble. The film starts off promisingly - with dynamic action and witty dialogue between Eddie and his symbiotic companion. Their relationship is still the best the series has to offer. Hardy brilliantly manages both comedic timing and dramatic moments. The visual effects are impressive in places, especially in the action sequences where Venom shows off his abilities. At other times, however, the CGI feels inadequate and more reminiscent of a video game from the last decade. Some fights are well choreographed, others are a chaotic mix of digital effects. The biggest problem is the script, which tries to be too ambitious. It mixes several storylines, introduces new characters and antagonists, but does not give them enough space to develop. The result is a rushed pace and superficial characters. The film's darker tone is a welcome change, but it often clashes with the comedic elements, creating an unbalanced whole. The film seems unsure whether it wants to be a serious drama or a lighthearted entertainment. Venom: The Last Dance is like a roller coaster - it's ups and downs. For fans of the series, it offers enough fun, but it's hard to call it a significant step forward. This film is like an average song on a great album, but as a whole it doesn't leave a strong impression. Fans will find their own, others may be disappointed.",Positive
880,"Maybe it's just because of my low expectations toward the series but it was just fun to watch. I've already lost hope for the trilogy to have a decent plot but I can say that this one has a better storyline than the second film.CGI was fine, I coudn't find any disturbing point. It was interesting to see the other symbiotes. I think those new symbiotes showed more symbiote-ish action scenes than venom when it comes to the fight ironically.There were a few funny jokes that made me laugh but I didn't really find Eddie's weird obsession for shoes funny, like was it supposed to be funny? Guess it was meant to be humor but well... it was almost tiring.",Neutral
881,"A solid enough send off for this 'Venom' trilogy.'Venom: The Last Dance' is decently amusing and produces enough entertainment with its plot. I didn't personally find it overly funny, though the person a few seats across from me had an absolute blast - never a bad thing seeing people enjoy themselves!Tom Hardy remains the key element of these films, they would be far less enjoyable without his presence. There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor stick out most from the other characters.",Negative

883,"Being Rated R probably would have saved this; I am just saying!This trilogy-capper almost makes me question if I have become more of a movie critic than a movie enjoyer. Then I remembered this is Sony's Spider-Man Universe we are talking about, which gave us films like ""Morbius"" and ""Madame Web."" I nonetheless went in here with an open mind, considering I do not mind the two previous ""Venom"" films that came out. After seeing ""The Last Dance,"" I question whether Sony was trying to set up their universe or give Eddie Brock and Venom the send-off they deserve. I am sadly leaning more toward the former.I should preface this review by telling you what I thought of the other two ""Venom"" films upon rewatch in preparation for this third installment. Those were entertaining yet disappointing superhero films saved by the performance of Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and Venom. The first was innocent enough, with a dull first and more engaging second half, a weak villain in Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake/Riot, exciting action, and Hardy performing nicely. Its sequel, ""Let There Be Carnage,"" surprisingly got better when revisiting it, easily surpassing its predecessor, with Hardy allowed to stretch his comedic abilities with Brock and Venom bickering hilariously. In addition, there is Woody Harrelson's enjoyable performance as Cletus Kasady/Carnage, who manages to rise above the flaws, including the disappointing inclusion of Naomie Harris' Frances Barrison/Shriek. Hardy was allowed to have fun with his characters, and the movies complimented him with a narrative that was not too complicated. The opposite is true for ""The Last Dance.""Let's get the positives out of the way first. It is a short list, which I am deeply saddened by, but I want to show you how it is not the worst superhero film out there or even the worst film of the year.Despite a woeful screenplay, Tom Hardy still does skillfully with Eddie Brock and Venom. He is not allowed to have as much fun as he did in the prior two films, but he is trying his best (right, the positives. Sorry).The rest of the cast delivered equally solid performances, with the other standout being Chiwetel Ejiofor as Orwell Taylor. Ejiofor always has a commanding presence whenever he is in a movie, with his characters of Baron Mordo in the two ""Doctor Strange"" films and Bathurst 2020 in the forgettable ""Infinite"" being the two I can think of at the top of my head. Even if the film is not the best, Ejiofor makes it work, and if it is fantastic, he always steals the show.The visual effects bring Venom and the other alien characters to gorgeous life. The other two ""Venom"" movies, granted, had remarkable CGI, but it is worth mentioning, specifically when discussing the positives.The action is somewhat fun. The ""Venom"" movies have always had enjoyable action. Unfortunately, ""The Last Dance"" was the least fun action-wise, but the first scene with action was sweet.The Venom symbiote is sometimes uniquely utilized. The trailers showcased Venom controlling a horse, and in the film, it is one of its best scenes. I am unsure if this is a spoiler, but he controls other animals, and they introduce other symbiotes, which is fun.I think that is it for the positives.I felt the portrayal of Eddie Brock and Venom this time was not good. Again, Hardy tried, but there were multiple times when it felt like he was bored. His character was, admittedly, bored at intervals, and Hardy is a screenwriter, but I am saying how it felt.The film tries to add new characters, but they are not compelling. The most obvious example is Dr. Payne, played by Juno Temple, who does nothing aside from believing that Brock is not a danger, while Ejiofor wants what is best for the world, considering the alien threat from Knull.Speaking of Knull, he was worse than Carlton Drake. He only sends alien minions to grab a MacGuffin that Venom has. I have not read the comics, but the impression I get from others and this movie is that Knull has a profound lore not represented here. Having Knull's alien pals and the Area 51 agents as the villains is too much, yet somehow too little.They also wasted Stephen Graham's Detective Mulligan. The trailers made it seem like Mulligan would be a principal and intriguing character. The only two interesting aspects about Mulligan are he has a symbiote and warns of Knull. That is it.Furthermore, it does not have that much comedy. ""Let There Be Carnage"" can easily be classified as a comedy, and I laughed more than I would like to admit. I think two laughs and three to five chuckles were all I had here. The film was not funny outside of the Venom horse and some banter between Brock and Venom.On top of that, there was not that much emotion. It is due to how much Brock and Venom were not well utilized and the clutter of characters. I did not care about the Area 51 personnel nor the unnamed family who brought Brock and Venom to Vegas. When the ending came along, which heightened the stakes to an unbelievable degree, I did not get emotional. It tried, but it failed to work.The other two ""Venom"" movies were entertaining, but this failed to come close. In an era where ""superhero fatigue"" is becoming more accepted, this trilogy-closer did not try anything new. Fascinating concepts here and there, and many standout scenes fail to save this disappointment in a franchise filled with them.Technically, a 6/10. Outside of the plot and the underwhelming screenplay, the visual effects remain exceptional, the actors did great, and the film functions.For the enjoyment score, I wanted to like this film. I had the sneaking suspicion that it might not work, but watching ""Let There Be Carnage"" increase in quality gave me hope. It was no ""Let There Be Carnage"" and is easily the weakest of the trilogy. It had the issues that plagued the likes of ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but does not come close to being as entertaining as them. I am so unhappy that the enjoyment score is a 4/10, but this trilogy deserved a better conclusion. Maybe it will get better when I watch it again, but as it stands, it is best for me to recommend you wait until Netflix or even Disney+.",Positive
884,"This movie was very middle of the road to me. Definitely better than the second one, but not as good as the original.I enjoyed the beginning very much. Nice pace, good story and funny at times. Also the last part was packed with action and it all looked amazing. Only thing I missed was some sort of a climax at the very end.The middle however, I did not care for too much. Some things felt forced, rushed and very unlikely. But as I often say in my reviews: 'It is a fictional, fantasy, action movie so who cares if some things do not add up.'As a whole I enjoyed it very much, Tom Hardy did not disappoint.",Positive
885,"I just don't get it, I thought the 1st Venom was good despite many fans may not have liked it. I'm not a comic fan, so for me it was good that they try to make it as relatable and realistic to just your average movie goer.The 2nd film was cringy and terrible in my opinion because the story didn't make much sense, too much drama, poetry, and bromance. I lost interest after watching that one but the trailer for this film looked good.Right from the beginning I realize this was going to be bad. I don't care about the multi-verse, I don't care about Knull, I don't care about all these comic lores. The story is completely unrelatable and the suspension of disbelief failed early on.And then to top it off, the ending was just awful.4/10 for the special effects. Everything else is a 0.",Negative
886,"If you've already come to terms with this version of Venom and Eddie Brock as more of a bromance than the savage, brutal duo from the comics, you're in for a fun ride, Venom: The Last Dance, the final chapter of the trilogy, delivers an entertaining ride with solid pacing, good performances, decent visual effects, and fun engaging enough story, added also with the joy of let all the madness fan service out makes Venom: The Last Dance an easy good time especially for me, even the serious part mostly with Chiwetel Ejiofor was executed pretty well, surprising wholesome moments with Rhys Ifans and his family characters, flawed? Sure, some of the editing cuts didn't quite work for me, there were a few cheesy, awkward moments that felt off, and nit picky here and there, overall, i have a good time with Venom: The Last Dance, and the most surprising thing also the least thing i could expect watching this supposed to be last time we'll see both Venom and Eddie was that i did get quite emotional at the end, it's clear they've evolved from mere host and symbiote to something much deeper, and their dynamic was surprisingly touching, my personal experience with these two also comes as long as these three movies together, and as the movie itself whether it's better than the first one which also a good movie in my opinion, The Last Dance succeeded my expectation from being far from bad, i want this goodbye to be at least watchable enough, and the result is more than that, Venom: The Last Dance is actually a good film, just like Venom would say, We are Venom, and this film makes sure we feel it.",Negative
887,"Fun, wild, and hot mess. There's too much plot that's never explained. Events just happen randomly with no payoff, with a big action scene towards the end. Eddie & Venom Bromance is the savior of this trilogy. If you enjoy the others you will enjoy this.Synopsis:
In Venom: The Last Dance, Tom Hardy returns as Venom, one of Marvel's greatest and most complex characters, for the final film in the trilogy. Eddie and Venom are on the run. Hunted by both of their worlds and with the net closing in, the duo are forced into a devastating decision that will bring the curtains down on Venom and Eddie's last dance.",Positive
888,"If you were hoping for a grand finale to the Venom franchise that would surpass the comedic heights of its predecessors, you're in for a letdown. While Venom: The Last Dance does deliver on the comedic front, it falls short in nearly every other aspect.The film picks up right where we left off, with Eddie Brock and Venom still on the run. The plot takes a convoluted turn as they become embroiled in a government conspiracy involving symbiotes and a dangerous threat to the universe. While the premise is intriguing, the execution feels rushed and often confusing.The real draw of this film, as with its predecessors, is the chemistry between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom. Their banter and witty exchanges provide much-needed humor and keep the film entertaining. However, the comedic elements can feel forced at times, and the overall tone can be uneven.The film's biggest flaw is its reliance on poor CGI and even worse dialogue. The visual effects, particularly those involving the titular symbiote, often feel like a step back from previous entries. Venom's appearances are fleeting, and when he does appear in full form, he's often overshadowed by lackluster animation.The script is equally disappointing. The story lacks depth and originality, and the characters feel one-dimensional. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the pacing feels uneven. While there are a few moments of humor that might elicit a chuckle, they're not enough to salvage the film.Ultimately, Venom: The Last Dance is a missed opportunity. It's a shame that such a potentially fun franchise has ended on such a sour note.",Negative
889,"If cinematic catastrophes could have a mascot, this would be standing at the front of the line, waving its tattered flag of mediocrity. Tom Hardy's final outing as Eddie Brock/Venom is not just a disappointment-it's an insult to audiences everywhere. To call this movie bad would be a kindness. This is an incoherent, muddled, and utterly joyless mess that somehow manages to fall short of even the lowest expectations.The premise of Eddie and Venom being ""on the run"" from both worlds promised at least some thrilling action. Instead, what we get is a chaotic, poorly-scripted nightmare of disjointed scenes and absurd plot holes big enough to swallow the entire Marvel universe. The narrative, if you can call it that, lurches forward with all the grace of a drunken man stumbling in the dark. There is no rhyme or reason to the events that unfold. It's like the writers cobbled together every half-baked idea they could think of and hoped nobody would notice how little sense any of it makes.The so-called ""devastating decision"" that Eddie and Venom face feels less like a culmination of their journey and more like a cheap, hollow ploy to yank on the audience's emotions. But even that attempt falls flat because, by the time it arrives, the viewer is too exhausted from enduring 90 minutes of mindless drivel to care.Eddie Brock, once a complex and conflicted anti-hero from the source comics, is reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self, mumbling and stumbling through the film like he just wants to get it over with.The supporting characters are even worse-if that's possible. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use cardboard cutouts of side characters nobody cares about and clearly has no understanding of what made the earlier films (barely) work.They serve no purpose other than to waste screen time and remind us that, yes, someone actually wrote this drivel down on paper.It wouldn't be a Venom movie without over-the-top CGI battles, right? Well, unfortunately, the action scenes here are so poorly executed and short to save cost that even those who came purely for mindless entertainment will leave disappointed. The special effects are a headache-inducing blur of dark, indistinguishable shapes smashing into each other, with zero sense of tension or creativity.The final fight scene feels like -an unintelligible swirl of chaos that is supposed to distract us from the fact that nothing of consequence is happening. It's not exciting, it's not entertaining, it's just ugly.At its core it tries to sell itself as a dramatic, emotional farewell to Eddie and Venom's bond, but it doesn't even come close to achieving that. Any attempt at emotional weight is drowned by the film's clumsy pacing and complete lack of character development. The so-called ""devastating"" decision feels unearned, forced, and utterly unconvincing. There is no sense of closure, no satisfying payoff-just a hollow, empty finale that leaves you wondering why you wasted your time in the first place.Avoid this movie like the symbiote plague it is. Eddie and Venom deserved better. We all deserved better.Tom's ego and nepotism to promote his FWB director both of whom had sole credit of writing the script should tell you that how much he actually despises the franchise.Tom was the ultimate culprit is giving the first movie it's comic tone and had heated arguments with Ruben Flesicher on set to such an extent that filming halted for a few days. There were 3 script writers on the first movie can you guess who was one of them?It's the director of this movie who with her relationship strong armed and hijacked the plot elements and forced to introduce the comic tone into the first movie by reshooting the movie which had resulted in a disjointed mess.Even the Ruben had expressed his deep regrets about that but I guess if you can control the leading star you can have your way.If you closely look at the tone of the first movie first trailer you will notice the horror and science fiction elements present which had been stripped down to barebones and gag and quips reigned supreme.",Negative
890,"My wife and I watched Venom: The Last Dance (2024) last night in theaters. The storyline follows Eddie Brock, who is on the run from the law and hiding in Mexico. When an invasion from Venom's home world begins, Eddie must make his way to Area 51 to find reinforcements and fight off the invaders.Directed by Kelly Marcel in her directorial debut, the film stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Rhys Ifans (The Amazing Spider-Man), Stephen Graham (Snatch), and Juno Temple (Killer Joe).I absolutely loved the first two-thirds of this film. Tom Hardy nailed his role, bringing a perfect blend of humor, action, and Venom's signature appetite for chaos. The various forms Venom takes are visually entertaining, and the self-deprecating humor is spot-on. We especially enjoyed the introduction of a quirky ""hippie family,"" who added a fun twist. However, once the story shifts to Area 51, things feel rushed and forced. The other symbiotes look incredible, but they come and go so quickly that you're left wanting more. The villain's defeat also felt underwhelming, and I wanted a bit more depth in their storyline. The homage at the end felt somewhat awkward as well.In conclusion, Venom: The Last Dance is a fun watch and definitely worth seeing for fans of the character, though it doesn't quite reach its full potential. I'd rate it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Positive

892,"Venom 3 is fun movie. It will never be critically rated, but it doesn't need or try to be. It is fun, it is weird, it looks good and the interactions between Eddie and Venom are great as always and are funny unlike the forced jokes that don't always land. We get to see a bit more of the rest of the symbiotes, but it is not a major focus of the movie to introduce or highlight them, which was a bit disappointing personally. The storyline is a bit messy, and there are a few plotholes and illogical, unexplainable events, but the movie does a good job of actually taking the viewers through it. We get and ending to the trilogy that is pretty much what you expect, but the emotional charge of it feels a bit forced and doesn't let the viewer appreciate it for themselves. We also get a glimpse of what may come in the future, including a namedrop that comic fans will get, so we may see more of our goofy antihero in the future.",Positive
893,"Venom The Last Dance was hilarious, emotional and entertaining. Went in with the same expectations as before very low. I'm shocked about the critics, cause they expected much more unreal scenarios. Here again Sony is not stupid of course they'd have added a specific character in their world, but they probably can't because of a certain contract clause. The third movie is much better than the second cause the second movie suffered from extreme cuts which took out all its potential. Despite the fact that Venom was rumored and in productions ever since early 00s it's no wonder they made a trilogy and had box office success, cause Tom Hardy carried those movies on his own. Every other actor wouldn't be able to pull out this great chemistry between him and Venom. I'm not biased I see its flaws and weaknesses, but my God some critics thrashed this movie as if it's another Morbius or Madame Web. It's by far a better movie.The road trip family was adorable not necessary but there to add a more family atmosphere and emotional touch to this film. Juno Temple was good but underperformed and here background story was dragged into this movie.Ms Cheng was probably the best positive highlight of the movie besides the love for dogs and animals in general.A lot of great symbionts and designs were actually great to watch. I can't say much more to that point cause I want to avoid spoilers.The issuesThe plot and goal of the movie is clear but gets lost through the movie. The action sequences and CGI were average at best. I know that sounds awful for a higher rating, but hear me out. The cast was decent and some actors really shined here.Another problem is the camera work here too many fast cuts hardly to see specially when I think I was obligated to watch it in 3D. I prefer 2D.The biggest problem was there is no clear 1 v 1 villain here with heart and intentions. We have Knull as the big bad in the background but barely seen but only to bait us fans to watch it and another mystery character from the army or swat like crew not shown at all. Where as the first two movies had clear antagonists shown.Issue / or averageThe Ending was emotional and impactful with rushed bangs, but man there were some scenes I really felt touched by it. I still think they could've done more and Tom deserved more !I give it 6 but as a trilogy part and the Tom Hardy factor a light 7, cause reviews between 1-4 stars are harsh. And yeah don't leave there are two important post credit scenes. I'm really looking forward !",Positive

895,"Barely emotional. Barely funny. Barely mediocre. From this pattern, it can be deducted that Venom: The Last Dance is a passable movie that doesn't do enough right to feel like an epic send off, or do anything inherently wrong to be worth complaining about. It's just fine.Tom Hardy is once again the easy stand-out as Eddie Brock, using the same janky physical actions as Venom manipulates his movements to an entertaining degree. The humour is the same safe but fine lines of dialogue that either evoke a chuckle or short exhale of breath. The action scenes escalate in levels of excitement throughout the film, with the final act especially delivering some really fun mayhem. And being the supposed final film of the trilogy, there are some surprisingly tender moments sprinkled in, but aren't frequent enough to draw any real emotion.As aforementioned, the humour is fine but there's one particular segment of the film in Las Vegas that feels too ridiculous and reckless in the context of the movie. Moreover, the story sets up rules that either get contradicted, forgotten, or straight up ignored for the sake of 'cool' scenes. Aside from Eddie and Venom, the rest of the cast of characters come off as either underutilised, underdeveloped, or unnecessary. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rhys Ifans feel criminally wasted, Juno Temple and Clark Backo undermine each other as their characters could've been just compiled into one due to their similar traits, and Stephen Graham and Peggy Lu don't do much to feel properly utilised, especially Graham, who's character felt like was building up to a bigger pay-off than what we got. And the antagonist Knull was so sidelined that there's not much more to say about him other than 'he was in the movie'.In conclusion, for what Venom: The Last Dance can't deliver in a concise plot or compelling side characters, it manages to make up for it with fun symbiote action and mostly entertaining and semi-heartfelt sequences.",Negative
896,"Sony should publicly apologise to the audience for making this worst movie and make the audience suffer and wasted their time. So boring story, nothing to appreciate only actor (Tom Hardy) has done, good acting Else, everyone, not done anything to discuss, that's why am giving one star.Don't waste your money by going into the theatres. CGI was good, but story was so pathetic. You can just guess the whole picture by trailer waste of money. Tom Hardy should try superhero movies with other Studios sony is not good with superheroes. We have already seen this with Superman. Middle part was so boring and ending was too predictable.",Negative
897,"Venom: The Last Dance delivers exactly what it promises-an absurdly fun, high-octane ride with a surprising amount of heart. If you expected Avengers: Endgame level of finality, you walked into the wrong theater, but for those who wanted a dumb but entertaining alien-human bromance, this one's for you.This film is easily the best in the trilogy, blending sharp pacing, humor that actually lands, and action sequences that never feel forced. The weird yet charming dynamic between Eddie and Venom is in full swing, and the filmmakers know exactly how to tap into the ridiculous yet endearing relationship that has become the backbone of this series. It's self-aware without feeling desperate for laughs, striking a balance that's tough to nail in superhero movies these days.While some of the gore pushes the limits of PG-13, it's never gratuitous. There's enough bite to the violence to keep you hooked, but it stops short of being overwhelming. If anything, it adds a little edge to an otherwise slick, polished blockbuster.But the real kicker here is that, amidst all the chaos, Venom: The Last Dance sneaks in some genuine emotion. It's a film about keeping your best bro close, and somehow that works. So why all the hate? It's a popcorn flick that knows exactly what it is, and honestly, that's rare these days.",Positive
898,Almost the whole cast was full. The only cast members that helped was the family and of course the store lady. Mulligan was boring . I felt there was a power struggle when writing this. One wanted to show ase strong women yet made them look stupied and to emotional; while the other smart men but utterly useless in the long run causing more havoc and not thinking before moving.The CGI are as ok. The one creatures could have been way way more creative for sure.Over all it's a lack luster film unfortunately 😕..there's so much they could have done with Tom and this story line. We needed a version of him and Spider man yet have been robbed of that.,Negative
899,"First and foremost, it felt like the makers made every poor decision possible when it came to the sound tracks and music. That which is supposed to amplify the intensity of ride simply let it remain bland throughout, even the climax, even the falling action.With Venom and Eddie having largely ceased their bickering, their bromance has dwindled significantly in this movie. Being the conclusional piece of this hilarious trilogy, it has fallen short of many expectations.Of course there was some of those promised action as witnessed in the trailers. But was there something which swept me off my feet which was absent from the trailers? Not really.While the villain's back-story is rather solid, it could have been more centre-stage. Most of the characters that have made appearance in this movie felt weakly woven together; though the plot could not have moved forward without their roles, they barely left any impact. Speaking of the plot, it largely remains uneventful, with the makers just throwing a few name-sake 3D effect villainous creatures at our faces. There is only one major action sequence throughout the film, that it low-key has bottled down to something I would either skim through, or watch at a slightly increased playback speed.If the unnecessary scenes, and by that I mean, 'adding no humor or value to the plot' scenes were deleted, it could easily boil down to half its current run-time. That being said, there could definitely be leads from where this movie has left loose ends at, but presently, it stays far aloof from being involved in such a gifting.I feel like the last of the trilogy has not done justice to the previous two movies, it almost feels like watching a different character. The ending in particular came off to me as a tryhard terrific ending, and even if the clips were good, the track choices really did not work out for me.",Negative
900,"Eddie and Venom are on the run as fugitives after their battle with Carnage. They are chased by military force and aliens that want to capture them for their codex to unleash a greater evil in their world. Eddie and Venom venture out for a while avoiding authorities and the alien species.I am a fan of the first Venom movie. It is not a well-made movie, but it is so entertaining because of Tom Hardy's crazy performance in both roles and the wacky humor throughout the film. The second movie is much better made mainly because of Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris, but I actually enjoyed the first one more on a fun level. I was pretty excited for the third film and the trailers had me hooked. Does this trilogy end on a memorable last dance?I have mixed thoughts on Venom: The Last Dance. Let's start with the good. I love Eddie and Venom's dynamic and they are at their best in this movie. They have fun chemistry and banter and it feels like they are finally starting to get along with each other a bit better. They also have a few emotional moments that can come off as cheesy, but they have charm especially one scene where Eddie reassures Martin's son that his alien friend is there to help and Venom thanks the kid for a piece of chocolate. In a movie filled with silly moments and action-packed battles, it is a really sweet moment that shows how heroic Eddie and Venom have become.It helps that Tom Hardy is an absolute joy to watch. Hardy relishes in both of his roles and he never lets up. There are several moments of him doing stuff like going crazy at the slot machine and creating a drink at the bar by himself in a quick way. He also handles the more dramatic scenes very well making the more emotional moments work better than they should have.Also, Venom is a very cool character here. He is funny, his powers are awesome and he does anything to protect Eddie even knowing that if they are both alive the aliens will track them down because they have a codex. Venom's antics are very endearing and it seems like he just wants to join the fun and even tries to get Eddie to join in. I love watching him take control of other animals such as a horse, a fish and a frog. Venom is so much fun to watch and he is a good reason why I enjoy these movies despite their faults.The humor is for the most part pretty good. There is one gag that I cringed at but other than that, I got several laughs out of this movie. The banter between Eddie and Venom never gets old for me.The action scenes are pretty entertaining. The chase scene in the river is a standout because it looks cool, it has Eddie Brock defend himself without Venom and Venom turning into other creatures. It is also frenetic and fun to see play out. The climax is also big full of cool moments, but it is a little CGI heavy. However, it features Venom on a motorcycle again and it looks great. Overall, I enjoyed the action.The cinematography by Fabian Wagner is solid and colorful. The lighting is also on point with all of the scenes being lit well enough to see while having some flare in the shots. This is by far the best looking Venom movie filmmaking wise. The special effects are more polished and the alien creatures chasing Venom and Eddie look very menacing. Honestly, they kind of remind me of the Kaijus from Pacific Rim and I like that. There also other symbiotes in the film and they look very cool with their designs, but some of their colors blend in. The visuals are not perfect, but they are an upgrade from the last two movies.All that said, there are a few problems I have with this movie. The biggest problem is that the script is overstuffed. I know that there needs to other plot lines to have the story come together, but some of them do not work at all. The scientists subplot is one of the most boring parts of the movie with how slowly paced it is and how the tone shifts from fun to dreary and not the good kind of dreary. The subplot with Martin and his family is okay and has some great moments, but it can drag a little too long.The supporting cast does not hold a candle to Tom Hardy. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Rex Strickland is the best supporting performance, but his character is too unlikable to root for. Dr. Payne is kind of there until the climax. Clark Backo as Sadie Christmas is alright and she does a lot in the climax, but her character does not stand out until then. Rhys Ifans is having a lot of fun in his role as a family man who believes in aliens. While his family may have gotten a little more focus than they should have, Ifans is pretty fun to watch at times. Andy Serkis as Knull is absolutely wasted. He seems like a menacing villain, but he gets little to do aside from getting expository dialogue. By far, the weakest link in the film and wastes Andy Serkis on a limited role.The tone is all over the place. There are moments where this movie acts like a cheesy road trip comedy with Eddie and Venom and then the next scene could be overly serious research about the symbiotes. The movie progressively darker as it goes along and it has some moments that should come off as emotional and while they kind of work because of Tom Hardy's performance and the duo's likability, they feel a bit unearned because of how comedic this series is by now. When Eddie and Venom ponder the life they could have had when in the car with Martin's family, it is hard to feel anything because they have been two goofballs most of the time. Without spoiling anything, ending is a mixed bag for me because it is sad, but not a tearjerker like the movie wants it to be.The musical score by Dan Deacon makes no impression on me. It just sounds like generic music from any other movie. The needle drops are okay, but I wish they could find another song than Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. However, the credits song One Last Dance by Tom and Roman Morello and Grandson is really catchy and a great song to end the movie. Also, Maroon 5's Memories has a great needle drop here.Venom: The Last Dance is an entertaining movie. It is not well-made and not even as fun as the first film, but I overall had a pretty good time with the movie despite the many issues it has. I guess I cannot help but find Eddie and Venom a lot of fun to watch. Director Kelly Marcel did a great job with the scenes with those two and with the action scenes, but I think she bit off more than she could chew with the other subplots. If you like the Venom movies, you will probably enjoy this movie but if you never them then this movie will not change your mind.Stay through all of the credits.",Positive
901,"It is genuinely impressive that Sony managed to make the most mediocre trilogy ever with such an iconic character.In terms of enjoyment, Eddie and Venom continue to be a delightfully fun duo. In this 3rd movie, they are basically on a road trip and that was relatively entertaining for the most part. The final act of the movie was also a pretty enjoyable CGI action fest with some emotional scenes.However, the story and script are still as flat as ever. The narrative feels very half baked with it feeling like a chain of things just randomly happening. Pointless characters that don't add much. Jokes being thrown at you just to see which land. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor characters could have been played by anyone but feels purposely done because they knew fans recognised them from other Marvel projects. The villain Knull looks cool but is just there to be teased for future projects.Overall, it is better than the second film but just on par with the first. It is a mediocre final entry. Sony continues to disappoint with their universe and We all know Venom is coming back somehow. I do worry for Spiderman 4 and hope Sony don't mess that movie in anyway.",Neutral
902,"""Venom: The Last Dance' is a messy buddy road trip in which you must turn your brains off...again.Is it perfect? Nah, far from it. I think there are way too many storylines in here, and the main one got some potential, but it was wasted in typical Sony fashion. The ""Spider-Man 4"" rumors have been blown out of proportion in my opinion, so temper your expectations.The duo between Eddie and Venom is as fun as always. I mean Tom Hardy and the banter between them...I'm sorry, the banter between Hardy and himself is the best part of these movies (Hardy is doing the voice of Venom).The humor is there, but can't say I laughed all that much, beacause most of the jokes are base level childish again. It must be a bit more emotional as a whole, because supposedly is the last time we see Venom (hardly doubt), but it ends up kinda hollow.Knull is there...I guess, but will see how and when they'll use him again...it's Sony after all.It's a popcorn movie that reminds me of the early 2000's comic book movies. The action in the third act is good for the most parts and there are some funny moments here and there. Are there plot holes and some issues with the story? Yes. It's just another ""Turn your brains off"" Sony movie again.There are two credit scenes, first one is kinda important, the second one not so much.",Positive
903,"My relationship with the Venom franchise has been rocky. I have a soft spot for the first one, absolutely loathe the second, and now we come to the trilogy's closer, and thankfully, it's an improvement.Venom: The Last Dance works best when it focuses on Eddie and Venom's story instead of trying to set up the future of the Sonyverse. If you didn't like the previous Venom films, this won't change your mind. It's still messy, but it gets more right than its predecessors.This is easily the campiest and most mature of the bunch. It takes its time with the characters, letting us sit with them instead of rushing into the next action set piece. Still being PG-13 it manages to cram in a lot more gore than its predecessors. The action is inventive, and the humor hits its mark. It also doesn't shy away from getting personal and emotional. Eddie and Venom's relationship has never felt more genuine. I'll admit-I teared up a few times by the end.Some may be disappointed by the potrayal of Knull, but personally, I loved it. He feels like an overlooming threat rather than an one-off villain, and the ""God of Darkness"" gets a Thanos-esque treatment he deserves.Now, don't get me wrong-the movie is still bad, technically speaking-but it's self-aware about that. Instead of being ""bad bad,"" it chooses to be ""fun bad"" and entertain you, and I respect that. Not every movie needs to be great; sometimes being fun is enough.Even with the lows, I have always found a weird sense of comfort with this rendition of Venom. I have found myself caring more for these characters than maybe even the script intended. So I am happy to say that by the end, it does enough to justify this trilogy's existence - and to such an satisfying extent that I'd rather live in a world where the Venom movies exist than one where it doesn't.",Positive
904,"The third installment about the symbiotic anti-hero is a mix of bright moments and disappointments. Tom Hardy once again proves why he is the perfect choice for the role of Eddie Brock/Venom, but even his charismatic performance cannot save the unbalanced ensemble. The film starts off promisingly - with dynamic action and witty dialogue between Eddie and his symbiotic companion. Their relationship is still the best the series has to offer. Hardy brilliantly manages both comedic timing and dramatic moments. The visual effects are impressive in places, especially in the action sequences where Venom shows off his abilities. At other times, however, the CGI feels inadequate and more reminiscent of a video game from the last decade. Some fights are well choreographed, others are a chaotic mix of digital effects. The biggest problem is the script, which tries to be too ambitious. It mixes several storylines, introduces new characters and antagonists, but does not give them enough space to develop. The result is a rushed pace and superficial characters. The film's darker tone is a welcome change, but it often clashes with the comedic elements, creating an unbalanced whole. The film seems unsure whether it wants to be a serious drama or a lighthearted entertainment. Venom: The Last Dance is like a roller coaster - it's ups and downs. For fans of the series, it offers enough fun, but it's hard to call it a significant step forward. This film is like an average song on a great album, but as a whole it doesn't leave a strong impression. Fans will find their own, others may be disappointed.",Positive
905,"Maybe it's just because of my low expectations toward the series but it was just fun to watch. I've already lost hope for the trilogy to have a decent plot but I can say that this one has a better storyline than the second film.CGI was fine, I coudn't find any disturbing point. It was interesting to see the other symbiotes. I think those new symbiotes showed more symbiote-ish action scenes than venom when it comes to the fight ironically.There were a few funny jokes that made me laugh but I didn't really find Eddie's weird obsession for shoes funny, like was it supposed to be funny? Guess it was meant to be humor but well... it was almost tiring.",Neutral
906,"A solid enough send off for this 'Venom' trilogy.'Venom: The Last Dance' is decently amusing and produces enough entertainment with its plot. I didn't personally find it overly funny, though the person a few seats across from me had an absolute blast - never a bad thing seeing people enjoy themselves!Tom Hardy remains the key element of these films, they would be far less enjoyable without his presence. There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor stick out most from the other characters.",Negative

908,"Being Rated R probably would have saved this; I am just saying!This trilogy-capper almost makes me question if I have become more of a movie critic than a movie enjoyer. Then I remembered this is Sony's Spider-Man Universe we are talking about, which gave us films like ""Morbius"" and ""Madame Web."" I nonetheless went in here with an open mind, considering I do not mind the two previous ""Venom"" films that came out. After seeing ""The Last Dance,"" I question whether Sony was trying to set up their universe or give Eddie Brock and Venom the send-off they deserve. I am sadly leaning more toward the former.I should preface this review by telling you what I thought of the other two ""Venom"" films upon rewatch in preparation for this third installment. Those were entertaining yet disappointing superhero films saved by the performance of Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and Venom. The first was innocent enough, with a dull first and more engaging second half, a weak villain in Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake/Riot, exciting action, and Hardy performing nicely. Its sequel, ""Let There Be Carnage,"" surprisingly got better when revisiting it, easily surpassing its predecessor, with Hardy allowed to stretch his comedic abilities with Brock and Venom bickering hilariously. In addition, there is Woody Harrelson's enjoyable performance as Cletus Kasady/Carnage, who manages to rise above the flaws, including the disappointing inclusion of Naomie Harris' Frances Barrison/Shriek. Hardy was allowed to have fun with his characters, and the movies complimented him with a narrative that was not too complicated. The opposite is true for ""The Last Dance.""Let's get the positives out of the way first. It is a short list, which I am deeply saddened by, but I want to show you how it is not the worst superhero film out there or even the worst film of the year.Despite a woeful screenplay, Tom Hardy still does skillfully with Eddie Brock and Venom. He is not allowed to have as much fun as he did in the prior two films, but he is trying his best (right, the positives. Sorry).The rest of the cast delivered equally solid performances, with the other standout being Chiwetel Ejiofor as Orwell Taylor. Ejiofor always has a commanding presence whenever he is in a movie, with his characters of Baron Mordo in the two ""Doctor Strange"" films and Bathurst 2020 in the forgettable ""Infinite"" being the two I can think of at the top of my head. Even if the film is not the best, Ejiofor makes it work, and if it is fantastic, he always steals the show.The visual effects bring Venom and the other alien characters to gorgeous life. The other two ""Venom"" movies, granted, had remarkable CGI, but it is worth mentioning, specifically when discussing the positives.The action is somewhat fun. The ""Venom"" movies have always had enjoyable action. Unfortunately, ""The Last Dance"" was the least fun action-wise, but the first scene with action was sweet.The Venom symbiote is sometimes uniquely utilized. The trailers showcased Venom controlling a horse, and in the film, it is one of its best scenes. I am unsure if this is a spoiler, but he controls other animals, and they introduce other symbiotes, which is fun.I think that is it for the positives.I felt the portrayal of Eddie Brock and Venom this time was not good. Again, Hardy tried, but there were multiple times when it felt like he was bored. His character was, admittedly, bored at intervals, and Hardy is a screenwriter, but I am saying how it felt.The film tries to add new characters, but they are not compelling. The most obvious example is Dr. Payne, played by Juno Temple, who does nothing aside from believing that Brock is not a danger, while Ejiofor wants what is best for the world, considering the alien threat from Knull.Speaking of Knull, he was worse than Carlton Drake. He only sends alien minions to grab a MacGuffin that Venom has. I have not read the comics, but the impression I get from others and this movie is that Knull has a profound lore not represented here. Having Knull's alien pals and the Area 51 agents as the villains is too much, yet somehow too little.They also wasted Stephen Graham's Detective Mulligan. The trailers made it seem like Mulligan would be a principal and intriguing character. The only two interesting aspects about Mulligan are he has a symbiote and warns of Knull. That is it.Furthermore, it does not have that much comedy. ""Let There Be Carnage"" can easily be classified as a comedy, and I laughed more than I would like to admit. I think two laughs and three to five chuckles were all I had here. The film was not funny outside of the Venom horse and some banter between Brock and Venom.On top of that, there was not that much emotion. It is due to how much Brock and Venom were not well utilized and the clutter of characters. I did not care about the Area 51 personnel nor the unnamed family who brought Brock and Venom to Vegas. When the ending came along, which heightened the stakes to an unbelievable degree, I did not get emotional. It tried, but it failed to work.The other two ""Venom"" movies were entertaining, but this failed to come close. In an era where ""superhero fatigue"" is becoming more accepted, this trilogy-closer did not try anything new. Fascinating concepts here and there, and many standout scenes fail to save this disappointment in a franchise filled with them.Technically, a 6/10. Outside of the plot and the underwhelming screenplay, the visual effects remain exceptional, the actors did great, and the film functions.For the enjoyment score, I wanted to like this film. I had the sneaking suspicion that it might not work, but watching ""Let There Be Carnage"" increase in quality gave me hope. It was no ""Let There Be Carnage"" and is easily the weakest of the trilogy. It had the issues that plagued the likes of ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but does not come close to being as entertaining as them. I am so unhappy that the enjoyment score is a 4/10, but this trilogy deserved a better conclusion. Maybe it will get better when I watch it again, but as it stands, it is best for me to recommend you wait until Netflix or even Disney+.",Positive
909,"This movie was very middle of the road to me. Definitely better than the second one, but not as good as the original.I enjoyed the beginning very much. Nice pace, good story and funny at times. Also the last part was packed with action and it all looked amazing. Only thing I missed was some sort of a climax at the very end.The middle however, I did not care for too much. Some things felt forced, rushed and very unlikely. But as I often say in my reviews: 'It is a fictional, fantasy, action movie so who cares if some things do not add up.'As a whole I enjoyed it very much, Tom Hardy did not disappoint.",Positive
910,"I just don't get it, I thought the 1st Venom was good despite many fans may not have liked it. I'm not a comic fan, so for me it was good that they try to make it as relatable and realistic to just your average movie goer.The 2nd film was cringy and terrible in my opinion because the story didn't make much sense, too much drama, poetry, and bromance. I lost interest after watching that one but the trailer for this film looked good.Right from the beginning I realize this was going to be bad. I don't care about the multi-verse, I don't care about Knull, I don't care about all these comic lores. The story is completely unrelatable and the suspension of disbelief failed early on.And then to top it off, the ending was just awful.4/10 for the special effects. Everything else is a 0.",Negative
911,"If you've already come to terms with this version of Venom and Eddie Brock as more of a bromance than the savage, brutal duo from the comics, you're in for a fun ride, Venom: The Last Dance, the final chapter of the trilogy, delivers an entertaining ride with solid pacing, good performances, decent visual effects, and fun engaging enough story, added also with the joy of let all the madness fan service out makes Venom: The Last Dance an easy good time especially for me, even the serious part mostly with Chiwetel Ejiofor was executed pretty well, surprising wholesome moments with Rhys Ifans and his family characters, flawed? Sure, some of the editing cuts didn't quite work for me, there were a few cheesy, awkward moments that felt off, and nit picky here and there, overall, i have a good time with Venom: The Last Dance, and the most surprising thing also the least thing i could expect watching this supposed to be last time we'll see both Venom and Eddie was that i did get quite emotional at the end, it's clear they've evolved from mere host and symbiote to something much deeper, and their dynamic was surprisingly touching, my personal experience with these two also comes as long as these three movies together, and as the movie itself whether it's better than the first one which also a good movie in my opinion, The Last Dance succeeded my expectation from being far from bad, i want this goodbye to be at least watchable enough, and the result is more than that, Venom: The Last Dance is actually a good film, just like Venom would say, We are Venom, and this film makes sure we feel it.",Negative
912,"Fun, wild, and hot mess. There's too much plot that's never explained. Events just happen randomly with no payoff, with a big action scene towards the end. Eddie & Venom Bromance is the savior of this trilogy. If you enjoy the others you will enjoy this.Synopsis:
In Venom: The Last Dance, Tom Hardy returns as Venom, one of Marvel's greatest and most complex characters, for the final film in the trilogy. Eddie and Venom are on the run. Hunted by both of their worlds and with the net closing in, the duo are forced into a devastating decision that will bring the curtains down on Venom and Eddie's last dance.",Positive
913,"If you were hoping for a grand finale to the Venom franchise that would surpass the comedic heights of its predecessors, you're in for a letdown. While Venom: The Last Dance does deliver on the comedic front, it falls short in nearly every other aspect.The film picks up right where we left off, with Eddie Brock and Venom still on the run. The plot takes a convoluted turn as they become embroiled in a government conspiracy involving symbiotes and a dangerous threat to the universe. While the premise is intriguing, the execution feels rushed and often confusing.The real draw of this film, as with its predecessors, is the chemistry between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom. Their banter and witty exchanges provide much-needed humor and keep the film entertaining. However, the comedic elements can feel forced at times, and the overall tone can be uneven.The film's biggest flaw is its reliance on poor CGI and even worse dialogue. The visual effects, particularly those involving the titular symbiote, often feel like a step back from previous entries. Venom's appearances are fleeting, and when he does appear in full form, he's often overshadowed by lackluster animation.The script is equally disappointing. The story lacks depth and originality, and the characters feel one-dimensional. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the pacing feels uneven. While there are a few moments of humor that might elicit a chuckle, they're not enough to salvage the film.Ultimately, Venom: The Last Dance is a missed opportunity. It's a shame that such a potentially fun franchise has ended on such a sour note.",Negative
914,"If cinematic catastrophes could have a mascot, this would be standing at the front of the line, waving its tattered flag of mediocrity. Tom Hardy's final outing as Eddie Brock/Venom is not just a disappointment-it's an insult to audiences everywhere. To call this movie bad would be a kindness. This is an incoherent, muddled, and utterly joyless mess that somehow manages to fall short of even the lowest expectations.The premise of Eddie and Venom being ""on the run"" from both worlds promised at least some thrilling action. Instead, what we get is a chaotic, poorly-scripted nightmare of disjointed scenes and absurd plot holes big enough to swallow the entire Marvel universe. The narrative, if you can call it that, lurches forward with all the grace of a drunken man stumbling in the dark. There is no rhyme or reason to the events that unfold. It's like the writers cobbled together every half-baked idea they could think of and hoped nobody would notice how little sense any of it makes.The so-called ""devastating decision"" that Eddie and Venom face feels less like a culmination of their journey and more like a cheap, hollow ploy to yank on the audience's emotions. But even that attempt falls flat because, by the time it arrives, the viewer is too exhausted from enduring 90 minutes of mindless drivel to care.Eddie Brock, once a complex and conflicted anti-hero from the source comics, is reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self, mumbling and stumbling through the film like he just wants to get it over with.The supporting characters are even worse-if that's possible. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use cardboard cutouts of side characters nobody cares about and clearly has no understanding of what made the earlier films (barely) work.They serve no purpose other than to waste screen time and remind us that, yes, someone actually wrote this drivel down on paper.It wouldn't be a Venom movie without over-the-top CGI battles, right? Well, unfortunately, the action scenes here are so poorly executed and short to save cost that even those who came purely for mindless entertainment will leave disappointed. The special effects are a headache-inducing blur of dark, indistinguishable shapes smashing into each other, with zero sense of tension or creativity.The final fight scene feels like -an unintelligible swirl of chaos that is supposed to distract us from the fact that nothing of consequence is happening. It's not exciting, it's not entertaining, it's just ugly.At its core it tries to sell itself as a dramatic, emotional farewell to Eddie and Venom's bond, but it doesn't even come close to achieving that. Any attempt at emotional weight is drowned by the film's clumsy pacing and complete lack of character development. The so-called ""devastating"" decision feels unearned, forced, and utterly unconvincing. There is no sense of closure, no satisfying payoff-just a hollow, empty finale that leaves you wondering why you wasted your time in the first place.Avoid this movie like the symbiote plague it is. Eddie and Venom deserved better. We all deserved better.Tom's ego and nepotism to promote his FWB director both of whom had sole credit of writing the script should tell you that how much he actually despises the franchise.Tom was the ultimate culprit is giving the first movie it's comic tone and had heated arguments with Ruben Flesicher on set to such an extent that filming halted for a few days. There were 3 script writers on the first movie can you guess who was one of them?It's the director of this movie who with her relationship strong armed and hijacked the plot elements and forced to introduce the comic tone into the first movie by reshooting the movie which had resulted in a disjointed mess.Even the Ruben had expressed his deep regrets about that but I guess if you can control the leading star you can have your way.If you closely look at the tone of the first movie first trailer you will notice the horror and science fiction elements present which had been stripped down to barebones and gag and quips reigned supreme.",Negative
915,"My wife and I watched Venom: The Last Dance (2024) last night in theaters. The storyline follows Eddie Brock, who is on the run from the law and hiding in Mexico. When an invasion from Venom's home world begins, Eddie must make his way to Area 51 to find reinforcements and fight off the invaders.Directed by Kelly Marcel in her directorial debut, the film stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Rhys Ifans (The Amazing Spider-Man), Stephen Graham (Snatch), and Juno Temple (Killer Joe).I absolutely loved the first two-thirds of this film. Tom Hardy nailed his role, bringing a perfect blend of humor, action, and Venom's signature appetite for chaos. The various forms Venom takes are visually entertaining, and the self-deprecating humor is spot-on. We especially enjoyed the introduction of a quirky ""hippie family,"" who added a fun twist. However, once the story shifts to Area 51, things feel rushed and forced. The other symbiotes look incredible, but they come and go so quickly that you're left wanting more. The villain's defeat also felt underwhelming, and I wanted a bit more depth in their storyline. The homage at the end felt somewhat awkward as well.In conclusion, Venom: The Last Dance is a fun watch and definitely worth seeing for fans of the character, though it doesn't quite reach its full potential. I'd rate it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Positive

917,"Venom 3 is fun movie. It will never be critically rated, but it doesn't need or try to be. It is fun, it is weird, it looks good and the interactions between Eddie and Venom are great as always and are funny unlike the forced jokes that don't always land. We get to see a bit more of the rest of the symbiotes, but it is not a major focus of the movie to introduce or highlight them, which was a bit disappointing personally. The storyline is a bit messy, and there are a few plotholes and illogical, unexplainable events, but the movie does a good job of actually taking the viewers through it. We get and ending to the trilogy that is pretty much what you expect, but the emotional charge of it feels a bit forced and doesn't let the viewer appreciate it for themselves. We also get a glimpse of what may come in the future, including a namedrop that comic fans will get, so we may see more of our goofy antihero in the future.",Positive
918,"Venom The Last Dance was hilarious, emotional and entertaining. Went in with the same expectations as before very low. I'm shocked about the critics, cause they expected much more unreal scenarios. Here again Sony is not stupid of course they'd have added a specific character in their world, but they probably can't because of a certain contract clause. The third movie is much better than the second cause the second movie suffered from extreme cuts which took out all its potential. Despite the fact that Venom was rumored and in productions ever since early 00s it's no wonder they made a trilogy and had box office success, cause Tom Hardy carried those movies on his own. Every other actor wouldn't be able to pull out this great chemistry between him and Venom. I'm not biased I see its flaws and weaknesses, but my God some critics thrashed this movie as if it's another Morbius or Madame Web. It's by far a better movie.The road trip family was adorable not necessary but there to add a more family atmosphere and emotional touch to this film. Juno Temple was good but underperformed and here background story was dragged into this movie.Ms Cheng was probably the best positive highlight of the movie besides the love for dogs and animals in general.A lot of great symbionts and designs were actually great to watch. I can't say much more to that point cause I want to avoid spoilers.The issuesThe plot and goal of the movie is clear but gets lost through the movie. The action sequences and CGI were average at best. I know that sounds awful for a higher rating, but hear me out. The cast was decent and some actors really shined here.Another problem is the camera work here too many fast cuts hardly to see specially when I think I was obligated to watch it in 3D. I prefer 2D.The biggest problem was there is no clear 1 v 1 villain here with heart and intentions. We have Knull as the big bad in the background but barely seen but only to bait us fans to watch it and another mystery character from the army or swat like crew not shown at all. Where as the first two movies had clear antagonists shown.Issue / or averageThe Ending was emotional and impactful with rushed bangs, but man there were some scenes I really felt touched by it. I still think they could've done more and Tom deserved more !I give it 6 but as a trilogy part and the Tom Hardy factor a light 7, cause reviews between 1-4 stars are harsh. And yeah don't leave there are two important post credit scenes. I'm really looking forward !",Positive

920,"Barely emotional. Barely funny. Barely mediocre. From this pattern, it can be deducted that Venom: The Last Dance is a passable movie that doesn't do enough right to feel like an epic send off, or do anything inherently wrong to be worth complaining about. It's just fine.Tom Hardy is once again the easy stand-out as Eddie Brock, using the same janky physical actions as Venom manipulates his movements to an entertaining degree. The humour is the same safe but fine lines of dialogue that either evoke a chuckle or short exhale of breath. The action scenes escalate in levels of excitement throughout the film, with the final act especially delivering some really fun mayhem. And being the supposed final film of the trilogy, there are some surprisingly tender moments sprinkled in, but aren't frequent enough to draw any real emotion.As aforementioned, the humour is fine but there's one particular segment of the film in Las Vegas that feels too ridiculous and reckless in the context of the movie. Moreover, the story sets up rules that either get contradicted, forgotten, or straight up ignored for the sake of 'cool' scenes. Aside from Eddie and Venom, the rest of the cast of characters come off as either underutilised, underdeveloped, or unnecessary. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rhys Ifans feel criminally wasted, Juno Temple and Clark Backo undermine each other as their characters could've been just compiled into one due to their similar traits, and Stephen Graham and Peggy Lu don't do much to feel properly utilised, especially Graham, who's character felt like was building up to a bigger pay-off than what we got. And the antagonist Knull was so sidelined that there's not much more to say about him other than 'he was in the movie'.In conclusion, for what Venom: The Last Dance can't deliver in a concise plot or compelling side characters, it manages to make up for it with fun symbiote action and mostly entertaining and semi-heartfelt sequences.",Negative
921,"Sony should publicly apologise to the audience for making this worst movie and make the audience suffer and wasted their time. So boring story, nothing to appreciate only actor (Tom Hardy) has done, good acting Else, everyone, not done anything to discuss, that's why am giving one star.Don't waste your money by going into the theatres. CGI was good, but story was so pathetic. You can just guess the whole picture by trailer waste of money. Tom Hardy should try superhero movies with other Studios sony is not good with superheroes. We have already seen this with Superman. Middle part was so boring and ending was too predictable.",Negative
922,"Venom: The Last Dance delivers exactly what it promises-an absurdly fun, high-octane ride with a surprising amount of heart. If you expected Avengers: Endgame level of finality, you walked into the wrong theater, but for those who wanted a dumb but entertaining alien-human bromance, this one's for you.This film is easily the best in the trilogy, blending sharp pacing, humor that actually lands, and action sequences that never feel forced. The weird yet charming dynamic between Eddie and Venom is in full swing, and the filmmakers know exactly how to tap into the ridiculous yet endearing relationship that has become the backbone of this series. It's self-aware without feeling desperate for laughs, striking a balance that's tough to nail in superhero movies these days.While some of the gore pushes the limits of PG-13, it's never gratuitous. There's enough bite to the violence to keep you hooked, but it stops short of being overwhelming. If anything, it adds a little edge to an otherwise slick, polished blockbuster.But the real kicker here is that, amidst all the chaos, Venom: The Last Dance sneaks in some genuine emotion. It's a film about keeping your best bro close, and somehow that works. So why all the hate? It's a popcorn flick that knows exactly what it is, and honestly, that's rare these days.",Positive
923,Almost the whole cast was full. The only cast members that helped was the family and of course the store lady. Mulligan was boring . I felt there was a power struggle when writing this. One wanted to show ase strong women yet made them look stupied and to emotional; while the other smart men but utterly useless in the long run causing more havoc and not thinking before moving.The CGI are as ok. The one creatures could have been way way more creative for sure.Over all it's a lack luster film unfortunately 😕..there's so much they could have done with Tom and this story line. We needed a version of him and Spider man yet have been robbed of that.,Negative
924,"First and foremost, it felt like the makers made every poor decision possible when it came to the sound tracks and music. That which is supposed to amplify the intensity of ride simply let it remain bland throughout, even the climax, even the falling action.With Venom and Eddie having largely ceased their bickering, their bromance has dwindled significantly in this movie. Being the conclusional piece of this hilarious trilogy, it has fallen short of many expectations.Of course there was some of those promised action as witnessed in the trailers. But was there something which swept me off my feet which was absent from the trailers? Not really.While the villain's back-story is rather solid, it could have been more centre-stage. Most of the characters that have made appearance in this movie felt weakly woven together; though the plot could not have moved forward without their roles, they barely left any impact. Speaking of the plot, it largely remains uneventful, with the makers just throwing a few name-sake 3D effect villainous creatures at our faces. There is only one major action sequence throughout the film, that it low-key has bottled down to something I would either skim through, or watch at a slightly increased playback speed.If the unnecessary scenes, and by that I mean, 'adding no humor or value to the plot' scenes were deleted, it could easily boil down to half its current run-time. That being said, there could definitely be leads from where this movie has left loose ends at, but presently, it stays far aloof from being involved in such a gifting.I feel like the last of the trilogy has not done justice to the previous two movies, it almost feels like watching a different character. The ending in particular came off to me as a tryhard terrific ending, and even if the clips were good, the track choices really did not work out for me.",Negative
925,"Eddie and Venom are on the run as fugitives after their battle with Carnage. They are chased by military force and aliens that want to capture them for their codex to unleash a greater evil in their world. Eddie and Venom venture out for a while avoiding authorities and the alien species.I am a fan of the first Venom movie. It is not a well-made movie, but it is so entertaining because of Tom Hardy's crazy performance in both roles and the wacky humor throughout the film. The second movie is much better made mainly because of Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris, but I actually enjoyed the first one more on a fun level. I was pretty excited for the third film and the trailers had me hooked. Does this trilogy end on a memorable last dance?I have mixed thoughts on Venom: The Last Dance. Let's start with the good. I love Eddie and Venom's dynamic and they are at their best in this movie. They have fun chemistry and banter and it feels like they are finally starting to get along with each other a bit better. They also have a few emotional moments that can come off as cheesy, but they have charm especially one scene where Eddie reassures Martin's son that his alien friend is there to help and Venom thanks the kid for a piece of chocolate. In a movie filled with silly moments and action-packed battles, it is a really sweet moment that shows how heroic Eddie and Venom have become.It helps that Tom Hardy is an absolute joy to watch. Hardy relishes in both of his roles and he never lets up. There are several moments of him doing stuff like going crazy at the slot machine and creating a drink at the bar by himself in a quick way. He also handles the more dramatic scenes very well making the more emotional moments work better than they should have.Also, Venom is a very cool character here. He is funny, his powers are awesome and he does anything to protect Eddie even knowing that if they are both alive the aliens will track them down because they have a codex. Venom's antics are very endearing and it seems like he just wants to join the fun and even tries to get Eddie to join in. I love watching him take control of other animals such as a horse, a fish and a frog. Venom is so much fun to watch and he is a good reason why I enjoy these movies despite their faults.The humor is for the most part pretty good. There is one gag that I cringed at but other than that, I got several laughs out of this movie. The banter between Eddie and Venom never gets old for me.The action scenes are pretty entertaining. The chase scene in the river is a standout because it looks cool, it has Eddie Brock defend himself without Venom and Venom turning into other creatures. It is also frenetic and fun to see play out. The climax is also big full of cool moments, but it is a little CGI heavy. However, it features Venom on a motorcycle again and it looks great. Overall, I enjoyed the action.The cinematography by Fabian Wagner is solid and colorful. The lighting is also on point with all of the scenes being lit well enough to see while having some flare in the shots. This is by far the best looking Venom movie filmmaking wise. The special effects are more polished and the alien creatures chasing Venom and Eddie look very menacing. Honestly, they kind of remind me of the Kaijus from Pacific Rim and I like that. There also other symbiotes in the film and they look very cool with their designs, but some of their colors blend in. The visuals are not perfect, but they are an upgrade from the last two movies.All that said, there are a few problems I have with this movie. The biggest problem is that the script is overstuffed. I know that there needs to other plot lines to have the story come together, but some of them do not work at all. The scientists subplot is one of the most boring parts of the movie with how slowly paced it is and how the tone shifts from fun to dreary and not the good kind of dreary. The subplot with Martin and his family is okay and has some great moments, but it can drag a little too long.The supporting cast does not hold a candle to Tom Hardy. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Rex Strickland is the best supporting performance, but his character is too unlikable to root for. Dr. Payne is kind of there until the climax. Clark Backo as Sadie Christmas is alright and she does a lot in the climax, but her character does not stand out until then. Rhys Ifans is having a lot of fun in his role as a family man who believes in aliens. While his family may have gotten a little more focus than they should have, Ifans is pretty fun to watch at times. Andy Serkis as Knull is absolutely wasted. He seems like a menacing villain, but he gets little to do aside from getting expository dialogue. By far, the weakest link in the film and wastes Andy Serkis on a limited role.The tone is all over the place. There are moments where this movie acts like a cheesy road trip comedy with Eddie and Venom and then the next scene could be overly serious research about the symbiotes. The movie progressively darker as it goes along and it has some moments that should come off as emotional and while they kind of work because of Tom Hardy's performance and the duo's likability, they feel a bit unearned because of how comedic this series is by now. When Eddie and Venom ponder the life they could have had when in the car with Martin's family, it is hard to feel anything because they have been two goofballs most of the time. Without spoiling anything, ending is a mixed bag for me because it is sad, but not a tearjerker like the movie wants it to be.The musical score by Dan Deacon makes no impression on me. It just sounds like generic music from any other movie. The needle drops are okay, but I wish they could find another song than Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. However, the credits song One Last Dance by Tom and Roman Morello and Grandson is really catchy and a great song to end the movie. Also, Maroon 5's Memories has a great needle drop here.Venom: The Last Dance is an entertaining movie. It is not well-made and not even as fun as the first film, but I overall had a pretty good time with the movie despite the many issues it has. I guess I cannot help but find Eddie and Venom a lot of fun to watch. Director Kelly Marcel did a great job with the scenes with those two and with the action scenes, but I think she bit off more than she could chew with the other subplots. If you like the Venom movies, you will probably enjoy this movie but if you never them then this movie will not change your mind.Stay through all of the credits.",Positive
926,"It is genuinely impressive that Sony managed to make the most mediocre trilogy ever with such an iconic character.In terms of enjoyment, Eddie and Venom continue to be a delightfully fun duo. In this 3rd movie, they are basically on a road trip and that was relatively entertaining for the most part. The final act of the movie was also a pretty enjoyable CGI action fest with some emotional scenes.However, the story and script are still as flat as ever. The narrative feels very half baked with it feeling like a chain of things just randomly happening. Pointless characters that don't add much. Jokes being thrown at you just to see which land. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor characters could have been played by anyone but feels purposely done because they knew fans recognised them from other Marvel projects. The villain Knull looks cool but is just there to be teased for future projects.Overall, it is better than the second film but just on par with the first. It is a mediocre final entry. Sony continues to disappoint with their universe and We all know Venom is coming back somehow. I do worry for Spiderman 4 and hope Sony don't mess that movie in anyway.",Neutral
927,"""Venom: The Last Dance' is a messy buddy road trip in which you must turn your brains off...again.Is it perfect? Nah, far from it. I think there are way too many storylines in here, and the main one got some potential, but it was wasted in typical Sony fashion. The ""Spider-Man 4"" rumors have been blown out of proportion in my opinion, so temper your expectations.The duo between Eddie and Venom is as fun as always. I mean Tom Hardy and the banter between them...I'm sorry, the banter between Hardy and himself is the best part of these movies (Hardy is doing the voice of Venom).The humor is there, but can't say I laughed all that much, beacause most of the jokes are base level childish again. It must be a bit more emotional as a whole, because supposedly is the last time we see Venom (hardly doubt), but it ends up kinda hollow.Knull is there...I guess, but will see how and when they'll use him again...it's Sony after all.It's a popcorn movie that reminds me of the early 2000's comic book movies. The action in the third act is good for the most parts and there are some funny moments here and there. Are there plot holes and some issues with the story? Yes. It's just another ""Turn your brains off"" Sony movie again.There are two credit scenes, first one is kinda important, the second one not so much.",Positive
928,"My relationship with the Venom franchise has been rocky. I have a soft spot for the first one, absolutely loathe the second, and now we come to the trilogy's closer, and thankfully, it's an improvement.Venom: The Last Dance works best when it focuses on Eddie and Venom's story instead of trying to set up the future of the Sonyverse. If you didn't like the previous Venom films, this won't change your mind. It's still messy, but it gets more right than its predecessors.This is easily the campiest and most mature of the bunch. It takes its time with the characters, letting us sit with them instead of rushing into the next action set piece. Still being PG-13 it manages to cram in a lot more gore than its predecessors. The action is inventive, and the humor hits its mark. It also doesn't shy away from getting personal and emotional. Eddie and Venom's relationship has never felt more genuine. I'll admit-I teared up a few times by the end.Some may be disappointed by the potrayal of Knull, but personally, I loved it. He feels like an overlooming threat rather than an one-off villain, and the ""God of Darkness"" gets a Thanos-esque treatment he deserves.Now, don't get me wrong-the movie is still bad, technically speaking-but it's self-aware about that. Instead of being ""bad bad,"" it chooses to be ""fun bad"" and entertain you, and I respect that. Not every movie needs to be great; sometimes being fun is enough.Even with the lows, I have always found a weird sense of comfort with this rendition of Venom. I have found myself caring more for these characters than maybe even the script intended. So I am happy to say that by the end, it does enough to justify this trilogy's existence - and to such an satisfying extent that I'd rather live in a world where the Venom movies exist than one where it doesn't.",Positive
929,"The third installment about the symbiotic anti-hero is a mix of bright moments and disappointments. Tom Hardy once again proves why he is the perfect choice for the role of Eddie Brock/Venom, but even his charismatic performance cannot save the unbalanced ensemble. The film starts off promisingly - with dynamic action and witty dialogue between Eddie and his symbiotic companion. Their relationship is still the best the series has to offer. Hardy brilliantly manages both comedic timing and dramatic moments. The visual effects are impressive in places, especially in the action sequences where Venom shows off his abilities. At other times, however, the CGI feels inadequate and more reminiscent of a video game from the last decade. Some fights are well choreographed, others are a chaotic mix of digital effects. The biggest problem is the script, which tries to be too ambitious. It mixes several storylines, introduces new characters and antagonists, but does not give them enough space to develop. The result is a rushed pace and superficial characters. The film's darker tone is a welcome change, but it often clashes with the comedic elements, creating an unbalanced whole. The film seems unsure whether it wants to be a serious drama or a lighthearted entertainment. Venom: The Last Dance is like a roller coaster - it's ups and downs. For fans of the series, it offers enough fun, but it's hard to call it a significant step forward. This film is like an average song on a great album, but as a whole it doesn't leave a strong impression. Fans will find their own, others may be disappointed.",Positive
930,"Maybe it's just because of my low expectations toward the series but it was just fun to watch. I've already lost hope for the trilogy to have a decent plot but I can say that this one has a better storyline than the second film.CGI was fine, I coudn't find any disturbing point. It was interesting to see the other symbiotes. I think those new symbiotes showed more symbiote-ish action scenes than venom when it comes to the fight ironically.There were a few funny jokes that made me laugh but I didn't really find Eddie's weird obsession for shoes funny, like was it supposed to be funny? Guess it was meant to be humor but well... it was almost tiring.",Neutral
931,"A solid enough send off for this 'Venom' trilogy.'Venom: The Last Dance' is decently amusing and produces enough entertainment with its plot. I didn't personally find it overly funny, though the person a few seats across from me had an absolute blast - never a bad thing seeing people enjoy themselves!Tom Hardy remains the key element of these films, they would be far less enjoyable without his presence. There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor stick out most from the other characters.",Negative

933,"Being Rated R probably would have saved this; I am just saying!This trilogy-capper almost makes me question if I have become more of a movie critic than a movie enjoyer. Then I remembered this is Sony's Spider-Man Universe we are talking about, which gave us films like ""Morbius"" and ""Madame Web."" I nonetheless went in here with an open mind, considering I do not mind the two previous ""Venom"" films that came out. After seeing ""The Last Dance,"" I question whether Sony was trying to set up their universe or give Eddie Brock and Venom the send-off they deserve. I am sadly leaning more toward the former.I should preface this review by telling you what I thought of the other two ""Venom"" films upon rewatch in preparation for this third installment. Those were entertaining yet disappointing superhero films saved by the performance of Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and Venom. The first was innocent enough, with a dull first and more engaging second half, a weak villain in Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake/Riot, exciting action, and Hardy performing nicely. Its sequel, ""Let There Be Carnage,"" surprisingly got better when revisiting it, easily surpassing its predecessor, with Hardy allowed to stretch his comedic abilities with Brock and Venom bickering hilariously. In addition, there is Woody Harrelson's enjoyable performance as Cletus Kasady/Carnage, who manages to rise above the flaws, including the disappointing inclusion of Naomie Harris' Frances Barrison/Shriek. Hardy was allowed to have fun with his characters, and the movies complimented him with a narrative that was not too complicated. The opposite is true for ""The Last Dance.""Let's get the positives out of the way first. It is a short list, which I am deeply saddened by, but I want to show you how it is not the worst superhero film out there or even the worst film of the year.Despite a woeful screenplay, Tom Hardy still does skillfully with Eddie Brock and Venom. He is not allowed to have as much fun as he did in the prior two films, but he is trying his best (right, the positives. Sorry).The rest of the cast delivered equally solid performances, with the other standout being Chiwetel Ejiofor as Orwell Taylor. Ejiofor always has a commanding presence whenever he is in a movie, with his characters of Baron Mordo in the two ""Doctor Strange"" films and Bathurst 2020 in the forgettable ""Infinite"" being the two I can think of at the top of my head. Even if the film is not the best, Ejiofor makes it work, and if it is fantastic, he always steals the show.The visual effects bring Venom and the other alien characters to gorgeous life. The other two ""Venom"" movies, granted, had remarkable CGI, but it is worth mentioning, specifically when discussing the positives.The action is somewhat fun. The ""Venom"" movies have always had enjoyable action. Unfortunately, ""The Last Dance"" was the least fun action-wise, but the first scene with action was sweet.The Venom symbiote is sometimes uniquely utilized. The trailers showcased Venom controlling a horse, and in the film, it is one of its best scenes. I am unsure if this is a spoiler, but he controls other animals, and they introduce other symbiotes, which is fun.I think that is it for the positives.I felt the portrayal of Eddie Brock and Venom this time was not good. Again, Hardy tried, but there were multiple times when it felt like he was bored. His character was, admittedly, bored at intervals, and Hardy is a screenwriter, but I am saying how it felt.The film tries to add new characters, but they are not compelling. The most obvious example is Dr. Payne, played by Juno Temple, who does nothing aside from believing that Brock is not a danger, while Ejiofor wants what is best for the world, considering the alien threat from Knull.Speaking of Knull, he was worse than Carlton Drake. He only sends alien minions to grab a MacGuffin that Venom has. I have not read the comics, but the impression I get from others and this movie is that Knull has a profound lore not represented here. Having Knull's alien pals and the Area 51 agents as the villains is too much, yet somehow too little.They also wasted Stephen Graham's Detective Mulligan. The trailers made it seem like Mulligan would be a principal and intriguing character. The only two interesting aspects about Mulligan are he has a symbiote and warns of Knull. That is it.Furthermore, it does not have that much comedy. ""Let There Be Carnage"" can easily be classified as a comedy, and I laughed more than I would like to admit. I think two laughs and three to five chuckles were all I had here. The film was not funny outside of the Venom horse and some banter between Brock and Venom.On top of that, there was not that much emotion. It is due to how much Brock and Venom were not well utilized and the clutter of characters. I did not care about the Area 51 personnel nor the unnamed family who brought Brock and Venom to Vegas. When the ending came along, which heightened the stakes to an unbelievable degree, I did not get emotional. It tried, but it failed to work.The other two ""Venom"" movies were entertaining, but this failed to come close. In an era where ""superhero fatigue"" is becoming more accepted, this trilogy-closer did not try anything new. Fascinating concepts here and there, and many standout scenes fail to save this disappointment in a franchise filled with them.Technically, a 6/10. Outside of the plot and the underwhelming screenplay, the visual effects remain exceptional, the actors did great, and the film functions.For the enjoyment score, I wanted to like this film. I had the sneaking suspicion that it might not work, but watching ""Let There Be Carnage"" increase in quality gave me hope. It was no ""Let There Be Carnage"" and is easily the weakest of the trilogy. It had the issues that plagued the likes of ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but does not come close to being as entertaining as them. I am so unhappy that the enjoyment score is a 4/10, but this trilogy deserved a better conclusion. Maybe it will get better when I watch it again, but as it stands, it is best for me to recommend you wait until Netflix or even Disney+.",Positive
934,"This movie was very middle of the road to me. Definitely better than the second one, but not as good as the original.I enjoyed the beginning very much. Nice pace, good story and funny at times. Also the last part was packed with action and it all looked amazing. Only thing I missed was some sort of a climax at the very end.The middle however, I did not care for too much. Some things felt forced, rushed and very unlikely. But as I often say in my reviews: 'It is a fictional, fantasy, action movie so who cares if some things do not add up.'As a whole I enjoyed it very much, Tom Hardy did not disappoint.",Positive
935,"I just don't get it, I thought the 1st Venom was good despite many fans may not have liked it. I'm not a comic fan, so for me it was good that they try to make it as relatable and realistic to just your average movie goer.The 2nd film was cringy and terrible in my opinion because the story didn't make much sense, too much drama, poetry, and bromance. I lost interest after watching that one but the trailer for this film looked good.Right from the beginning I realize this was going to be bad. I don't care about the multi-verse, I don't care about Knull, I don't care about all these comic lores. The story is completely unrelatable and the suspension of disbelief failed early on.And then to top it off, the ending was just awful.4/10 for the special effects. Everything else is a 0.",Negative
936,"If you've already come to terms with this version of Venom and Eddie Brock as more of a bromance than the savage, brutal duo from the comics, you're in for a fun ride, Venom: The Last Dance, the final chapter of the trilogy, delivers an entertaining ride with solid pacing, good performances, decent visual effects, and fun engaging enough story, added also with the joy of let all the madness fan service out makes Venom: The Last Dance an easy good time especially for me, even the serious part mostly with Chiwetel Ejiofor was executed pretty well, surprising wholesome moments with Rhys Ifans and his family characters, flawed? Sure, some of the editing cuts didn't quite work for me, there were a few cheesy, awkward moments that felt off, and nit picky here and there, overall, i have a good time with Venom: The Last Dance, and the most surprising thing also the least thing i could expect watching this supposed to be last time we'll see both Venom and Eddie was that i did get quite emotional at the end, it's clear they've evolved from mere host and symbiote to something much deeper, and their dynamic was surprisingly touching, my personal experience with these two also comes as long as these three movies together, and as the movie itself whether it's better than the first one which also a good movie in my opinion, The Last Dance succeeded my expectation from being far from bad, i want this goodbye to be at least watchable enough, and the result is more than that, Venom: The Last Dance is actually a good film, just like Venom would say, We are Venom, and this film makes sure we feel it.",Negative

938,"If you were hoping for a grand finale to the Venom franchise that would surpass the comedic heights of its predecessors, you're in for a letdown. While Venom: The Last Dance does deliver on the comedic front, it falls short in nearly every other aspect.The film picks up right where we left off, with Eddie Brock and Venom still on the run. The plot takes a convoluted turn as they become embroiled in a government conspiracy involving symbiotes and a dangerous threat to the universe. While the premise is intriguing, the execution feels rushed and often confusing.The real draw of this film, as with its predecessors, is the chemistry between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom. Their banter and witty exchanges provide much-needed humor and keep the film entertaining. However, the comedic elements can feel forced at times, and the overall tone can be uneven.The film's biggest flaw is its reliance on poor CGI and even worse dialogue. The visual effects, particularly those involving the titular symbiote, often feel like a step back from previous entries. Venom's appearances are fleeting, and when he does appear in full form, he's often overshadowed by lackluster animation.The script is equally disappointing. The story lacks depth and originality, and the characters feel one-dimensional. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the pacing feels uneven. While there are a few moments of humor that might elicit a chuckle, they're not enough to salvage the film.Ultimately, Venom: The Last Dance is a missed opportunity. It's a shame that such a potentially fun franchise has ended on such a sour note.",Negative
939,"If cinematic catastrophes could have a mascot, this would be standing at the front of the line, waving its tattered flag of mediocrity. Tom Hardy's final outing as Eddie Brock/Venom is not just a disappointment-it's an insult to audiences everywhere. To call this movie bad would be a kindness. This is an incoherent, muddled, and utterly joyless mess that somehow manages to fall short of even the lowest expectations.The premise of Eddie and Venom being ""on the run"" from both worlds promised at least some thrilling action. Instead, what we get is a chaotic, poorly-scripted nightmare of disjointed scenes and absurd plot holes big enough to swallow the entire Marvel universe. The narrative, if you can call it that, lurches forward with all the grace of a drunken man stumbling in the dark. There is no rhyme or reason to the events that unfold. It's like the writers cobbled together every half-baked idea they could think of and hoped nobody would notice how little sense any of it makes.The so-called ""devastating decision"" that Eddie and Venom face feels less like a culmination of their journey and more like a cheap, hollow ploy to yank on the audience's emotions. But even that attempt falls flat because, by the time it arrives, the viewer is too exhausted from enduring 90 minutes of mindless drivel to care.Eddie Brock, once a complex and conflicted anti-hero from the source comics, is reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self, mumbling and stumbling through the film like he just wants to get it over with.The supporting characters are even worse-if that's possible. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use cardboard cutouts of side characters nobody cares about and clearly has no understanding of what made the earlier films (barely) work.They serve no purpose other than to waste screen time and remind us that, yes, someone actually wrote this drivel down on paper.It wouldn't be a Venom movie without over-the-top CGI battles, right? Well, unfortunately, the action scenes here are so poorly executed and short to save cost that even those who came purely for mindless entertainment will leave disappointed. The special effects are a headache-inducing blur of dark, indistinguishable shapes smashing into each other, with zero sense of tension or creativity.The final fight scene feels like -an unintelligible swirl of chaos that is supposed to distract us from the fact that nothing of consequence is happening. It's not exciting, it's not entertaining, it's just ugly.At its core it tries to sell itself as a dramatic, emotional farewell to Eddie and Venom's bond, but it doesn't even come close to achieving that. Any attempt at emotional weight is drowned by the film's clumsy pacing and complete lack of character development. The so-called ""devastating"" decision feels unearned, forced, and utterly unconvincing. There is no sense of closure, no satisfying payoff-just a hollow, empty finale that leaves you wondering why you wasted your time in the first place.Avoid this movie like the symbiote plague it is. Eddie and Venom deserved better. We all deserved better.Tom's ego and nepotism to promote his FWB director both of whom had sole credit of writing the script should tell you that how much he actually despises the franchise.Tom was the ultimate culprit is giving the first movie it's comic tone and had heated arguments with Ruben Flesicher on set to such an extent that filming halted for a few days. There were 3 script writers on the first movie can you guess who was one of them?It's the director of this movie who with her relationship strong armed and hijacked the plot elements and forced to introduce the comic tone into the first movie by reshooting the movie which had resulted in a disjointed mess.Even the Ruben had expressed his deep regrets about that but I guess if you can control the leading star you can have your way.If you closely look at the tone of the first movie first trailer you will notice the horror and science fiction elements present which had been stripped down to barebones and gag and quips reigned supreme.",Negative
940,"My wife and I watched Venom: The Last Dance (2024) last night in theaters. The storyline follows Eddie Brock, who is on the run from the law and hiding in Mexico. When an invasion from Venom's home world begins, Eddie must make his way to Area 51 to find reinforcements and fight off the invaders.Directed by Kelly Marcel in her directorial debut, the film stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Rhys Ifans (The Amazing Spider-Man), Stephen Graham (Snatch), and Juno Temple (Killer Joe).I absolutely loved the first two-thirds of this film. Tom Hardy nailed his role, bringing a perfect blend of humor, action, and Venom's signature appetite for chaos. The various forms Venom takes are visually entertaining, and the self-deprecating humor is spot-on. We especially enjoyed the introduction of a quirky ""hippie family,"" who added a fun twist. However, once the story shifts to Area 51, things feel rushed and forced. The other symbiotes look incredible, but they come and go so quickly that you're left wanting more. The villain's defeat also felt underwhelming, and I wanted a bit more depth in their storyline. The homage at the end felt somewhat awkward as well.In conclusion, Venom: The Last Dance is a fun watch and definitely worth seeing for fans of the character, though it doesn't quite reach its full potential. I'd rate it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Positive

942,"Venom 3 is fun movie. It will never be critically rated, but it doesn't need or try to be. It is fun, it is weird, it looks good and the interactions between Eddie and Venom are great as always and are funny unlike the forced jokes that don't always land. We get to see a bit more of the rest of the symbiotes, but it is not a major focus of the movie to introduce or highlight them, which was a bit disappointing personally. The storyline is a bit messy, and there are a few plotholes and illogical, unexplainable events, but the movie does a good job of actually taking the viewers through it. We get and ending to the trilogy that is pretty much what you expect, but the emotional charge of it feels a bit forced and doesn't let the viewer appreciate it for themselves. We also get a glimpse of what may come in the future, including a namedrop that comic fans will get, so we may see more of our goofy antihero in the future.",Positive
943,"Venom The Last Dance was hilarious, emotional and entertaining. Went in with the same expectations as before very low. I'm shocked about the critics, cause they expected much more unreal scenarios. Here again Sony is not stupid of course they'd have added a specific character in their world, but they probably can't because of a certain contract clause. The third movie is much better than the second cause the second movie suffered from extreme cuts which took out all its potential. Despite the fact that Venom was rumored and in productions ever since early 00s it's no wonder they made a trilogy and had box office success, cause Tom Hardy carried those movies on his own. Every other actor wouldn't be able to pull out this great chemistry between him and Venom. I'm not biased I see its flaws and weaknesses, but my God some critics thrashed this movie as if it's another Morbius or Madame Web. It's by far a better movie.The road trip family was adorable not necessary but there to add a more family atmosphere and emotional touch to this film. Juno Temple was good but underperformed and here background story was dragged into this movie.Ms Cheng was probably the best positive highlight of the movie besides the love for dogs and animals in general.A lot of great symbionts and designs were actually great to watch. I can't say much more to that point cause I want to avoid spoilers.The issuesThe plot and goal of the movie is clear but gets lost through the movie. The action sequences and CGI were average at best. I know that sounds awful for a higher rating, but hear me out. The cast was decent and some actors really shined here.Another problem is the camera work here too many fast cuts hardly to see specially when I think I was obligated to watch it in 3D. I prefer 2D.The biggest problem was there is no clear 1 v 1 villain here with heart and intentions. We have Knull as the big bad in the background but barely seen but only to bait us fans to watch it and another mystery character from the army or swat like crew not shown at all. Where as the first two movies had clear antagonists shown.Issue / or averageThe Ending was emotional and impactful with rushed bangs, but man there were some scenes I really felt touched by it. I still think they could've done more and Tom deserved more !I give it 6 but as a trilogy part and the Tom Hardy factor a light 7, cause reviews between 1-4 stars are harsh. And yeah don't leave there are two important post credit scenes. I'm really looking forward !",Positive

945,"Barely emotional. Barely funny. Barely mediocre. From this pattern, it can be deducted that Venom: The Last Dance is a passable movie that doesn't do enough right to feel like an epic send off, or do anything inherently wrong to be worth complaining about. It's just fine.Tom Hardy is once again the easy stand-out as Eddie Brock, using the same janky physical actions as Venom manipulates his movements to an entertaining degree. The humour is the same safe but fine lines of dialogue that either evoke a chuckle or short exhale of breath. The action scenes escalate in levels of excitement throughout the film, with the final act especially delivering some really fun mayhem. And being the supposed final film of the trilogy, there are some surprisingly tender moments sprinkled in, but aren't frequent enough to draw any real emotion.As aforementioned, the humour is fine but there's one particular segment of the film in Las Vegas that feels too ridiculous and reckless in the context of the movie. Moreover, the story sets up rules that either get contradicted, forgotten, or straight up ignored for the sake of 'cool' scenes. Aside from Eddie and Venom, the rest of the cast of characters come off as either underutilised, underdeveloped, or unnecessary. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rhys Ifans feel criminally wasted, Juno Temple and Clark Backo undermine each other as their characters could've been just compiled into one due to their similar traits, and Stephen Graham and Peggy Lu don't do much to feel properly utilised, especially Graham, who's character felt like was building up to a bigger pay-off than what we got. And the antagonist Knull was so sidelined that there's not much more to say about him other than 'he was in the movie'.In conclusion, for what Venom: The Last Dance can't deliver in a concise plot or compelling side characters, it manages to make up for it with fun symbiote action and mostly entertaining and semi-heartfelt sequences.",Negative
946,"Sony should publicly apologise to the audience for making this worst movie and make the audience suffer and wasted their time. So boring story, nothing to appreciate only actor (Tom Hardy) has done, good acting Else, everyone, not done anything to discuss, that's why am giving one star.Don't waste your money by going into the theatres. CGI was good, but story was so pathetic. You can just guess the whole picture by trailer waste of money. Tom Hardy should try superhero movies with other Studios sony is not good with superheroes. We have already seen this with Superman. Middle part was so boring and ending was too predictable.",Negative
947,"Venom: The Last Dance delivers exactly what it promises-an absurdly fun, high-octane ride with a surprising amount of heart. If you expected Avengers: Endgame level of finality, you walked into the wrong theater, but for those who wanted a dumb but entertaining alien-human bromance, this one's for you.This film is easily the best in the trilogy, blending sharp pacing, humor that actually lands, and action sequences that never feel forced. The weird yet charming dynamic between Eddie and Venom is in full swing, and the filmmakers know exactly how to tap into the ridiculous yet endearing relationship that has become the backbone of this series. It's self-aware without feeling desperate for laughs, striking a balance that's tough to nail in superhero movies these days.While some of the gore pushes the limits of PG-13, it's never gratuitous. There's enough bite to the violence to keep you hooked, but it stops short of being overwhelming. If anything, it adds a little edge to an otherwise slick, polished blockbuster.But the real kicker here is that, amidst all the chaos, Venom: The Last Dance sneaks in some genuine emotion. It's a film about keeping your best bro close, and somehow that works. So why all the hate? It's a popcorn flick that knows exactly what it is, and honestly, that's rare these days.",Positive
948,Almost the whole cast was full. The only cast members that helped was the family and of course the store lady. Mulligan was boring . I felt there was a power struggle when writing this. One wanted to show ase strong women yet made them look stupied and to emotional; while the other smart men but utterly useless in the long run causing more havoc and not thinking before moving.The CGI are as ok. The one creatures could have been way way more creative for sure.Over all it's a lack luster film unfortunately 😕..there's so much they could have done with Tom and this story line. We needed a version of him and Spider man yet have been robbed of that.,Negative
949,"First and foremost, it felt like the makers made every poor decision possible when it came to the sound tracks and music. That which is supposed to amplify the intensity of ride simply let it remain bland throughout, even the climax, even the falling action.With Venom and Eddie having largely ceased their bickering, their bromance has dwindled significantly in this movie. Being the conclusional piece of this hilarious trilogy, it has fallen short of many expectations.Of course there was some of those promised action as witnessed in the trailers. But was there something which swept me off my feet which was absent from the trailers? Not really.While the villain's back-story is rather solid, it could have been more centre-stage. Most of the characters that have made appearance in this movie felt weakly woven together; though the plot could not have moved forward without their roles, they barely left any impact. Speaking of the plot, it largely remains uneventful, with the makers just throwing a few name-sake 3D effect villainous creatures at our faces. There is only one major action sequence throughout the film, that it low-key has bottled down to something I would either skim through, or watch at a slightly increased playback speed.If the unnecessary scenes, and by that I mean, 'adding no humor or value to the plot' scenes were deleted, it could easily boil down to half its current run-time. That being said, there could definitely be leads from where this movie has left loose ends at, but presently, it stays far aloof from being involved in such a gifting.I feel like the last of the trilogy has not done justice to the previous two movies, it almost feels like watching a different character. The ending in particular came off to me as a tryhard terrific ending, and even if the clips were good, the track choices really did not work out for me.",Negative
950,"Eddie and Venom are on the run as fugitives after their battle with Carnage. They are chased by military force and aliens that want to capture them for their codex to unleash a greater evil in their world. Eddie and Venom venture out for a while avoiding authorities and the alien species.I am a fan of the first Venom movie. It is not a well-made movie, but it is so entertaining because of Tom Hardy's crazy performance in both roles and the wacky humor throughout the film. The second movie is much better made mainly because of Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris, but I actually enjoyed the first one more on a fun level. I was pretty excited for the third film and the trailers had me hooked. Does this trilogy end on a memorable last dance?I have mixed thoughts on Venom: The Last Dance. Let's start with the good. I love Eddie and Venom's dynamic and they are at their best in this movie. They have fun chemistry and banter and it feels like they are finally starting to get along with each other a bit better. They also have a few emotional moments that can come off as cheesy, but they have charm especially one scene where Eddie reassures Martin's son that his alien friend is there to help and Venom thanks the kid for a piece of chocolate. In a movie filled with silly moments and action-packed battles, it is a really sweet moment that shows how heroic Eddie and Venom have become.It helps that Tom Hardy is an absolute joy to watch. Hardy relishes in both of his roles and he never lets up. There are several moments of him doing stuff like going crazy at the slot machine and creating a drink at the bar by himself in a quick way. He also handles the more dramatic scenes very well making the more emotional moments work better than they should have.Also, Venom is a very cool character here. He is funny, his powers are awesome and he does anything to protect Eddie even knowing that if they are both alive the aliens will track them down because they have a codex. Venom's antics are very endearing and it seems like he just wants to join the fun and even tries to get Eddie to join in. I love watching him take control of other animals such as a horse, a fish and a frog. Venom is so much fun to watch and he is a good reason why I enjoy these movies despite their faults.The humor is for the most part pretty good. There is one gag that I cringed at but other than that, I got several laughs out of this movie. The banter between Eddie and Venom never gets old for me.The action scenes are pretty entertaining. The chase scene in the river is a standout because it looks cool, it has Eddie Brock defend himself without Venom and Venom turning into other creatures. It is also frenetic and fun to see play out. The climax is also big full of cool moments, but it is a little CGI heavy. However, it features Venom on a motorcycle again and it looks great. Overall, I enjoyed the action.The cinematography by Fabian Wagner is solid and colorful. The lighting is also on point with all of the scenes being lit well enough to see while having some flare in the shots. This is by far the best looking Venom movie filmmaking wise. The special effects are more polished and the alien creatures chasing Venom and Eddie look very menacing. Honestly, they kind of remind me of the Kaijus from Pacific Rim and I like that. There also other symbiotes in the film and they look very cool with their designs, but some of their colors blend in. The visuals are not perfect, but they are an upgrade from the last two movies.All that said, there are a few problems I have with this movie. The biggest problem is that the script is overstuffed. I know that there needs to other plot lines to have the story come together, but some of them do not work at all. The scientists subplot is one of the most boring parts of the movie with how slowly paced it is and how the tone shifts from fun to dreary and not the good kind of dreary. The subplot with Martin and his family is okay and has some great moments, but it can drag a little too long.The supporting cast does not hold a candle to Tom Hardy. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Rex Strickland is the best supporting performance, but his character is too unlikable to root for. Dr. Payne is kind of there until the climax. Clark Backo as Sadie Christmas is alright and she does a lot in the climax, but her character does not stand out until then. Rhys Ifans is having a lot of fun in his role as a family man who believes in aliens. While his family may have gotten a little more focus than they should have, Ifans is pretty fun to watch at times. Andy Serkis as Knull is absolutely wasted. He seems like a menacing villain, but he gets little to do aside from getting expository dialogue. By far, the weakest link in the film and wastes Andy Serkis on a limited role.The tone is all over the place. There are moments where this movie acts like a cheesy road trip comedy with Eddie and Venom and then the next scene could be overly serious research about the symbiotes. The movie progressively darker as it goes along and it has some moments that should come off as emotional and while they kind of work because of Tom Hardy's performance and the duo's likability, they feel a bit unearned because of how comedic this series is by now. When Eddie and Venom ponder the life they could have had when in the car with Martin's family, it is hard to feel anything because they have been two goofballs most of the time. Without spoiling anything, ending is a mixed bag for me because it is sad, but not a tearjerker like the movie wants it to be.The musical score by Dan Deacon makes no impression on me. It just sounds like generic music from any other movie. The needle drops are okay, but I wish they could find another song than Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. However, the credits song One Last Dance by Tom and Roman Morello and Grandson is really catchy and a great song to end the movie. Also, Maroon 5's Memories has a great needle drop here.Venom: The Last Dance is an entertaining movie. It is not well-made and not even as fun as the first film, but I overall had a pretty good time with the movie despite the many issues it has. I guess I cannot help but find Eddie and Venom a lot of fun to watch. Director Kelly Marcel did a great job with the scenes with those two and with the action scenes, but I think she bit off more than she could chew with the other subplots. If you like the Venom movies, you will probably enjoy this movie but if you never them then this movie will not change your mind.Stay through all of the credits.",Positive
951,"It is genuinely impressive that Sony managed to make the most mediocre trilogy ever with such an iconic character.In terms of enjoyment, Eddie and Venom continue to be a delightfully fun duo. In this 3rd movie, they are basically on a road trip and that was relatively entertaining for the most part. The final act of the movie was also a pretty enjoyable CGI action fest with some emotional scenes.However, the story and script are still as flat as ever. The narrative feels very half baked with it feeling like a chain of things just randomly happening. Pointless characters that don't add much. Jokes being thrown at you just to see which land. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor characters could have been played by anyone but feels purposely done because they knew fans recognised them from other Marvel projects. The villain Knull looks cool but is just there to be teased for future projects.Overall, it is better than the second film but just on par with the first. It is a mediocre final entry. Sony continues to disappoint with their universe and We all know Venom is coming back somehow. I do worry for Spiderman 4 and hope Sony don't mess that movie in anyway.",Neutral
952,"""Venom: The Last Dance' is a messy buddy road trip in which you must turn your brains off...again.Is it perfect? Nah, far from it. I think there are way too many storylines in here, and the main one got some potential, but it was wasted in typical Sony fashion. The ""Spider-Man 4"" rumors have been blown out of proportion in my opinion, so temper your expectations.The duo between Eddie and Venom is as fun as always. I mean Tom Hardy and the banter between them...I'm sorry, the banter between Hardy and himself is the best part of these movies (Hardy is doing the voice of Venom).The humor is there, but can't say I laughed all that much, beacause most of the jokes are base level childish again. It must be a bit more emotional as a whole, because supposedly is the last time we see Venom (hardly doubt), but it ends up kinda hollow.Knull is there...I guess, but will see how and when they'll use him again...it's Sony after all.It's a popcorn movie that reminds me of the early 2000's comic book movies. The action in the third act is good for the most parts and there are some funny moments here and there. Are there plot holes and some issues with the story? Yes. It's just another ""Turn your brains off"" Sony movie again.There are two credit scenes, first one is kinda important, the second one not so much.",Positive
953,"My relationship with the Venom franchise has been rocky. I have a soft spot for the first one, absolutely loathe the second, and now we come to the trilogy's closer, and thankfully, it's an improvement.Venom: The Last Dance works best when it focuses on Eddie and Venom's story instead of trying to set up the future of the Sonyverse. If you didn't like the previous Venom films, this won't change your mind. It's still messy, but it gets more right than its predecessors.This is easily the campiest and most mature of the bunch. It takes its time with the characters, letting us sit with them instead of rushing into the next action set piece. Still being PG-13 it manages to cram in a lot more gore than its predecessors. The action is inventive, and the humor hits its mark. It also doesn't shy away from getting personal and emotional. Eddie and Venom's relationship has never felt more genuine. I'll admit-I teared up a few times by the end.Some may be disappointed by the potrayal of Knull, but personally, I loved it. He feels like an overlooming threat rather than an one-off villain, and the ""God of Darkness"" gets a Thanos-esque treatment he deserves.Now, don't get me wrong-the movie is still bad, technically speaking-but it's self-aware about that. Instead of being ""bad bad,"" it chooses to be ""fun bad"" and entertain you, and I respect that. Not every movie needs to be great; sometimes being fun is enough.Even with the lows, I have always found a weird sense of comfort with this rendition of Venom. I have found myself caring more for these characters than maybe even the script intended. So I am happy to say that by the end, it does enough to justify this trilogy's existence - and to such an satisfying extent that I'd rather live in a world where the Venom movies exist than one where it doesn't.",Positive
954,"The third installment about the symbiotic anti-hero is a mix of bright moments and disappointments. Tom Hardy once again proves why he is the perfect choice for the role of Eddie Brock/Venom, but even his charismatic performance cannot save the unbalanced ensemble. The film starts off promisingly - with dynamic action and witty dialogue between Eddie and his symbiotic companion. Their relationship is still the best the series has to offer. Hardy brilliantly manages both comedic timing and dramatic moments. The visual effects are impressive in places, especially in the action sequences where Venom shows off his abilities. At other times, however, the CGI feels inadequate and more reminiscent of a video game from the last decade. Some fights are well choreographed, others are a chaotic mix of digital effects. The biggest problem is the script, which tries to be too ambitious. It mixes several storylines, introduces new characters and antagonists, but does not give them enough space to develop. The result is a rushed pace and superficial characters. The film's darker tone is a welcome change, but it often clashes with the comedic elements, creating an unbalanced whole. The film seems unsure whether it wants to be a serious drama or a lighthearted entertainment. Venom: The Last Dance is like a roller coaster - it's ups and downs. For fans of the series, it offers enough fun, but it's hard to call it a significant step forward. This film is like an average song on a great album, but as a whole it doesn't leave a strong impression. Fans will find their own, others may be disappointed.",Positive
955,"Maybe it's just because of my low expectations toward the series but it was just fun to watch. I've already lost hope for the trilogy to have a decent plot but I can say that this one has a better storyline than the second film.CGI was fine, I coudn't find any disturbing point. It was interesting to see the other symbiotes. I think those new symbiotes showed more symbiote-ish action scenes than venom when it comes to the fight ironically.There were a few funny jokes that made me laugh but I didn't really find Eddie's weird obsession for shoes funny, like was it supposed to be funny? Guess it was meant to be humor but well... it was almost tiring.",Neutral
956,"A solid enough send off for this 'Venom' trilogy.'Venom: The Last Dance' is decently amusing and produces enough entertainment with its plot. I didn't personally find it overly funny, though the person a few seats across from me had an absolute blast - never a bad thing seeing people enjoy themselves!Tom Hardy remains the key element of these films, they would be far less enjoyable without his presence. There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor stick out most from the other characters.",Negative

958,"Being Rated R probably would have saved this; I am just saying!This trilogy-capper almost makes me question if I have become more of a movie critic than a movie enjoyer. Then I remembered this is Sony's Spider-Man Universe we are talking about, which gave us films like ""Morbius"" and ""Madame Web."" I nonetheless went in here with an open mind, considering I do not mind the two previous ""Venom"" films that came out. After seeing ""The Last Dance,"" I question whether Sony was trying to set up their universe or give Eddie Brock and Venom the send-off they deserve. I am sadly leaning more toward the former.I should preface this review by telling you what I thought of the other two ""Venom"" films upon rewatch in preparation for this third installment. Those were entertaining yet disappointing superhero films saved by the performance of Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and Venom. The first was innocent enough, with a dull first and more engaging second half, a weak villain in Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake/Riot, exciting action, and Hardy performing nicely. Its sequel, ""Let There Be Carnage,"" surprisingly got better when revisiting it, easily surpassing its predecessor, with Hardy allowed to stretch his comedic abilities with Brock and Venom bickering hilariously. In addition, there is Woody Harrelson's enjoyable performance as Cletus Kasady/Carnage, who manages to rise above the flaws, including the disappointing inclusion of Naomie Harris' Frances Barrison/Shriek. Hardy was allowed to have fun with his characters, and the movies complimented him with a narrative that was not too complicated. The opposite is true for ""The Last Dance.""Let's get the positives out of the way first. It is a short list, which I am deeply saddened by, but I want to show you how it is not the worst superhero film out there or even the worst film of the year.Despite a woeful screenplay, Tom Hardy still does skillfully with Eddie Brock and Venom. He is not allowed to have as much fun as he did in the prior two films, but he is trying his best (right, the positives. Sorry).The rest of the cast delivered equally solid performances, with the other standout being Chiwetel Ejiofor as Orwell Taylor. Ejiofor always has a commanding presence whenever he is in a movie, with his characters of Baron Mordo in the two ""Doctor Strange"" films and Bathurst 2020 in the forgettable ""Infinite"" being the two I can think of at the top of my head. Even if the film is not the best, Ejiofor makes it work, and if it is fantastic, he always steals the show.The visual effects bring Venom and the other alien characters to gorgeous life. The other two ""Venom"" movies, granted, had remarkable CGI, but it is worth mentioning, specifically when discussing the positives.The action is somewhat fun. The ""Venom"" movies have always had enjoyable action. Unfortunately, ""The Last Dance"" was the least fun action-wise, but the first scene with action was sweet.The Venom symbiote is sometimes uniquely utilized. The trailers showcased Venom controlling a horse, and in the film, it is one of its best scenes. I am unsure if this is a spoiler, but he controls other animals, and they introduce other symbiotes, which is fun.I think that is it for the positives.I felt the portrayal of Eddie Brock and Venom this time was not good. Again, Hardy tried, but there were multiple times when it felt like he was bored. His character was, admittedly, bored at intervals, and Hardy is a screenwriter, but I am saying how it felt.The film tries to add new characters, but they are not compelling. The most obvious example is Dr. Payne, played by Juno Temple, who does nothing aside from believing that Brock is not a danger, while Ejiofor wants what is best for the world, considering the alien threat from Knull.Speaking of Knull, he was worse than Carlton Drake. He only sends alien minions to grab a MacGuffin that Venom has. I have not read the comics, but the impression I get from others and this movie is that Knull has a profound lore not represented here. Having Knull's alien pals and the Area 51 agents as the villains is too much, yet somehow too little.They also wasted Stephen Graham's Detective Mulligan. The trailers made it seem like Mulligan would be a principal and intriguing character. The only two interesting aspects about Mulligan are he has a symbiote and warns of Knull. That is it.Furthermore, it does not have that much comedy. ""Let There Be Carnage"" can easily be classified as a comedy, and I laughed more than I would like to admit. I think two laughs and three to five chuckles were all I had here. The film was not funny outside of the Venom horse and some banter between Brock and Venom.On top of that, there was not that much emotion. It is due to how much Brock and Venom were not well utilized and the clutter of characters. I did not care about the Area 51 personnel nor the unnamed family who brought Brock and Venom to Vegas. When the ending came along, which heightened the stakes to an unbelievable degree, I did not get emotional. It tried, but it failed to work.The other two ""Venom"" movies were entertaining, but this failed to come close. In an era where ""superhero fatigue"" is becoming more accepted, this trilogy-closer did not try anything new. Fascinating concepts here and there, and many standout scenes fail to save this disappointment in a franchise filled with them.Technically, a 6/10. Outside of the plot and the underwhelming screenplay, the visual effects remain exceptional, the actors did great, and the film functions.For the enjoyment score, I wanted to like this film. I had the sneaking suspicion that it might not work, but watching ""Let There Be Carnage"" increase in quality gave me hope. It was no ""Let There Be Carnage"" and is easily the weakest of the trilogy. It had the issues that plagued the likes of ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but does not come close to being as entertaining as them. I am so unhappy that the enjoyment score is a 4/10, but this trilogy deserved a better conclusion. Maybe it will get better when I watch it again, but as it stands, it is best for me to recommend you wait until Netflix or even Disney+.",Positive
959,"This movie was very middle of the road to me. Definitely better than the second one, but not as good as the original.I enjoyed the beginning very much. Nice pace, good story and funny at times. Also the last part was packed with action and it all looked amazing. Only thing I missed was some sort of a climax at the very end.The middle however, I did not care for too much. Some things felt forced, rushed and very unlikely. But as I often say in my reviews: 'It is a fictional, fantasy, action movie so who cares if some things do not add up.'As a whole I enjoyed it very much, Tom Hardy did not disappoint.",Positive
960,"I just don't get it, I thought the 1st Venom was good despite many fans may not have liked it. I'm not a comic fan, so for me it was good that they try to make it as relatable and realistic to just your average movie goer.The 2nd film was cringy and terrible in my opinion because the story didn't make much sense, too much drama, poetry, and bromance. I lost interest after watching that one but the trailer for this film looked good.Right from the beginning I realize this was going to be bad. I don't care about the multi-verse, I don't care about Knull, I don't care about all these comic lores. The story is completely unrelatable and the suspension of disbelief failed early on.And then to top it off, the ending was just awful.4/10 for the special effects. Everything else is a 0.",Negative
961,"If you've already come to terms with this version of Venom and Eddie Brock as more of a bromance than the savage, brutal duo from the comics, you're in for a fun ride, Venom: The Last Dance, the final chapter of the trilogy, delivers an entertaining ride with solid pacing, good performances, decent visual effects, and fun engaging enough story, added also with the joy of let all the madness fan service out makes Venom: The Last Dance an easy good time especially for me, even the serious part mostly with Chiwetel Ejiofor was executed pretty well, surprising wholesome moments with Rhys Ifans and his family characters, flawed? Sure, some of the editing cuts didn't quite work for me, there were a few cheesy, awkward moments that felt off, and nit picky here and there, overall, i have a good time with Venom: The Last Dance, and the most surprising thing also the least thing i could expect watching this supposed to be last time we'll see both Venom and Eddie was that i did get quite emotional at the end, it's clear they've evolved from mere host and symbiote to something much deeper, and their dynamic was surprisingly touching, my personal experience with these two also comes as long as these three movies together, and as the movie itself whether it's better than the first one which also a good movie in my opinion, The Last Dance succeeded my expectation from being far from bad, i want this goodbye to be at least watchable enough, and the result is more than that, Venom: The Last Dance is actually a good film, just like Venom would say, We are Venom, and this film makes sure we feel it.",Negative
962,"Fun, wild, and hot mess. There's too much plot that's never explained. Events just happen randomly with no payoff, with a big action scene towards the end. Eddie & Venom Bromance is the savior of this trilogy. If you enjoy the others you will enjoy this.Synopsis:
In Venom: The Last Dance, Tom Hardy returns as Venom, one of Marvel's greatest and most complex characters, for the final film in the trilogy. Eddie and Venom are on the run. Hunted by both of their worlds and with the net closing in, the duo are forced into a devastating decision that will bring the curtains down on Venom and Eddie's last dance.",Positive
963,"If you were hoping for a grand finale to the Venom franchise that would surpass the comedic heights of its predecessors, you're in for a letdown. While Venom: The Last Dance does deliver on the comedic front, it falls short in nearly every other aspect.The film picks up right where we left off, with Eddie Brock and Venom still on the run. The plot takes a convoluted turn as they become embroiled in a government conspiracy involving symbiotes and a dangerous threat to the universe. While the premise is intriguing, the execution feels rushed and often confusing.The real draw of this film, as with its predecessors, is the chemistry between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom. Their banter and witty exchanges provide much-needed humor and keep the film entertaining. However, the comedic elements can feel forced at times, and the overall tone can be uneven.The film's biggest flaw is its reliance on poor CGI and even worse dialogue. The visual effects, particularly those involving the titular symbiote, often feel like a step back from previous entries. Venom's appearances are fleeting, and when he does appear in full form, he's often overshadowed by lackluster animation.The script is equally disappointing. The story lacks depth and originality, and the characters feel one-dimensional. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the pacing feels uneven. While there are a few moments of humor that might elicit a chuckle, they're not enough to salvage the film.Ultimately, Venom: The Last Dance is a missed opportunity. It's a shame that such a potentially fun franchise has ended on such a sour note.",Negative
964,"If cinematic catastrophes could have a mascot, this would be standing at the front of the line, waving its tattered flag of mediocrity. Tom Hardy's final outing as Eddie Brock/Venom is not just a disappointment-it's an insult to audiences everywhere. To call this movie bad would be a kindness. This is an incoherent, muddled, and utterly joyless mess that somehow manages to fall short of even the lowest expectations.The premise of Eddie and Venom being ""on the run"" from both worlds promised at least some thrilling action. Instead, what we get is a chaotic, poorly-scripted nightmare of disjointed scenes and absurd plot holes big enough to swallow the entire Marvel universe. The narrative, if you can call it that, lurches forward with all the grace of a drunken man stumbling in the dark. There is no rhyme or reason to the events that unfold. It's like the writers cobbled together every half-baked idea they could think of and hoped nobody would notice how little sense any of it makes.The so-called ""devastating decision"" that Eddie and Venom face feels less like a culmination of their journey and more like a cheap, hollow ploy to yank on the audience's emotions. But even that attempt falls flat because, by the time it arrives, the viewer is too exhausted from enduring 90 minutes of mindless drivel to care.Eddie Brock, once a complex and conflicted anti-hero from the source comics, is reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self, mumbling and stumbling through the film like he just wants to get it over with.The supporting characters are even worse-if that's possible. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use cardboard cutouts of side characters nobody cares about and clearly has no understanding of what made the earlier films (barely) work.They serve no purpose other than to waste screen time and remind us that, yes, someone actually wrote this drivel down on paper.It wouldn't be a Venom movie without over-the-top CGI battles, right? Well, unfortunately, the action scenes here are so poorly executed and short to save cost that even those who came purely for mindless entertainment will leave disappointed. The special effects are a headache-inducing blur of dark, indistinguishable shapes smashing into each other, with zero sense of tension or creativity.The final fight scene feels like -an unintelligible swirl of chaos that is supposed to distract us from the fact that nothing of consequence is happening. It's not exciting, it's not entertaining, it's just ugly.At its core it tries to sell itself as a dramatic, emotional farewell to Eddie and Venom's bond, but it doesn't even come close to achieving that. Any attempt at emotional weight is drowned by the film's clumsy pacing and complete lack of character development. The so-called ""devastating"" decision feels unearned, forced, and utterly unconvincing. There is no sense of closure, no satisfying payoff-just a hollow, empty finale that leaves you wondering why you wasted your time in the first place.Avoid this movie like the symbiote plague it is. Eddie and Venom deserved better. We all deserved better.Tom's ego and nepotism to promote his FWB director both of whom had sole credit of writing the script should tell you that how much he actually despises the franchise.Tom was the ultimate culprit is giving the first movie it's comic tone and had heated arguments with Ruben Flesicher on set to such an extent that filming halted for a few days. There were 3 script writers on the first movie can you guess who was one of them?It's the director of this movie who with her relationship strong armed and hijacked the plot elements and forced to introduce the comic tone into the first movie by reshooting the movie which had resulted in a disjointed mess.Even the Ruben had expressed his deep regrets about that but I guess if you can control the leading star you can have your way.If you closely look at the tone of the first movie first trailer you will notice the horror and science fiction elements present which had been stripped down to barebones and gag and quips reigned supreme.",Negative
965,"My wife and I watched Venom: The Last Dance (2024) last night in theaters. The storyline follows Eddie Brock, who is on the run from the law and hiding in Mexico. When an invasion from Venom's home world begins, Eddie must make his way to Area 51 to find reinforcements and fight off the invaders.Directed by Kelly Marcel in her directorial debut, the film stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Rhys Ifans (The Amazing Spider-Man), Stephen Graham (Snatch), and Juno Temple (Killer Joe).I absolutely loved the first two-thirds of this film. Tom Hardy nailed his role, bringing a perfect blend of humor, action, and Venom's signature appetite for chaos. The various forms Venom takes are visually entertaining, and the self-deprecating humor is spot-on. We especially enjoyed the introduction of a quirky ""hippie family,"" who added a fun twist. However, once the story shifts to Area 51, things feel rushed and forced. The other symbiotes look incredible, but they come and go so quickly that you're left wanting more. The villain's defeat also felt underwhelming, and I wanted a bit more depth in their storyline. The homage at the end felt somewhat awkward as well.In conclusion, Venom: The Last Dance is a fun watch and definitely worth seeing for fans of the character, though it doesn't quite reach its full potential. I'd rate it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Positive

967,"Venom 3 is fun movie. It will never be critically rated, but it doesn't need or try to be. It is fun, it is weird, it looks good and the interactions between Eddie and Venom are great as always and are funny unlike the forced jokes that don't always land. We get to see a bit more of the rest of the symbiotes, but it is not a major focus of the movie to introduce or highlight them, which was a bit disappointing personally. The storyline is a bit messy, and there are a few plotholes and illogical, unexplainable events, but the movie does a good job of actually taking the viewers through it. We get and ending to the trilogy that is pretty much what you expect, but the emotional charge of it feels a bit forced and doesn't let the viewer appreciate it for themselves. We also get a glimpse of what may come in the future, including a namedrop that comic fans will get, so we may see more of our goofy antihero in the future.",Positive
968,"Venom The Last Dance was hilarious, emotional and entertaining. Went in with the same expectations as before very low. I'm shocked about the critics, cause they expected much more unreal scenarios. Here again Sony is not stupid of course they'd have added a specific character in their world, but they probably can't because of a certain contract clause. The third movie is much better than the second cause the second movie suffered from extreme cuts which took out all its potential. Despite the fact that Venom was rumored and in productions ever since early 00s it's no wonder they made a trilogy and had box office success, cause Tom Hardy carried those movies on his own. Every other actor wouldn't be able to pull out this great chemistry between him and Venom. I'm not biased I see its flaws and weaknesses, but my God some critics thrashed this movie as if it's another Morbius or Madame Web. It's by far a better movie.The road trip family was adorable not necessary but there to add a more family atmosphere and emotional touch to this film. Juno Temple was good but underperformed and here background story was dragged into this movie.Ms Cheng was probably the best positive highlight of the movie besides the love for dogs and animals in general.A lot of great symbionts and designs were actually great to watch. I can't say much more to that point cause I want to avoid spoilers.The issuesThe plot and goal of the movie is clear but gets lost through the movie. The action sequences and CGI were average at best. I know that sounds awful for a higher rating, but hear me out. The cast was decent and some actors really shined here.Another problem is the camera work here too many fast cuts hardly to see specially when I think I was obligated to watch it in 3D. I prefer 2D.The biggest problem was there is no clear 1 v 1 villain here with heart and intentions. We have Knull as the big bad in the background but barely seen but only to bait us fans to watch it and another mystery character from the army or swat like crew not shown at all. Where as the first two movies had clear antagonists shown.Issue / or averageThe Ending was emotional and impactful with rushed bangs, but man there were some scenes I really felt touched by it. I still think they could've done more and Tom deserved more !I give it 6 but as a trilogy part and the Tom Hardy factor a light 7, cause reviews between 1-4 stars are harsh. And yeah don't leave there are two important post credit scenes. I'm really looking forward !",Positive

970,"Barely emotional. Barely funny. Barely mediocre. From this pattern, it can be deducted that Venom: The Last Dance is a passable movie that doesn't do enough right to feel like an epic send off, or do anything inherently wrong to be worth complaining about. It's just fine.Tom Hardy is once again the easy stand-out as Eddie Brock, using the same janky physical actions as Venom manipulates his movements to an entertaining degree. The humour is the same safe but fine lines of dialogue that either evoke a chuckle or short exhale of breath. The action scenes escalate in levels of excitement throughout the film, with the final act especially delivering some really fun mayhem. And being the supposed final film of the trilogy, there are some surprisingly tender moments sprinkled in, but aren't frequent enough to draw any real emotion.As aforementioned, the humour is fine but there's one particular segment of the film in Las Vegas that feels too ridiculous and reckless in the context of the movie. Moreover, the story sets up rules that either get contradicted, forgotten, or straight up ignored for the sake of 'cool' scenes. Aside from Eddie and Venom, the rest of the cast of characters come off as either underutilised, underdeveloped, or unnecessary. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rhys Ifans feel criminally wasted, Juno Temple and Clark Backo undermine each other as their characters could've been just compiled into one due to their similar traits, and Stephen Graham and Peggy Lu don't do much to feel properly utilised, especially Graham, who's character felt like was building up to a bigger pay-off than what we got. And the antagonist Knull was so sidelined that there's not much more to say about him other than 'he was in the movie'.In conclusion, for what Venom: The Last Dance can't deliver in a concise plot or compelling side characters, it manages to make up for it with fun symbiote action and mostly entertaining and semi-heartfelt sequences.",Negative
971,"Sony should publicly apologise to the audience for making this worst movie and make the audience suffer and wasted their time. So boring story, nothing to appreciate only actor (Tom Hardy) has done, good acting Else, everyone, not done anything to discuss, that's why am giving one star.Don't waste your money by going into the theatres. CGI was good, but story was so pathetic. You can just guess the whole picture by trailer waste of money. Tom Hardy should try superhero movies with other Studios sony is not good with superheroes. We have already seen this with Superman. Middle part was so boring and ending was too predictable.",Negative
972,"Venom: The Last Dance delivers exactly what it promises-an absurdly fun, high-octane ride with a surprising amount of heart. If you expected Avengers: Endgame level of finality, you walked into the wrong theater, but for those who wanted a dumb but entertaining alien-human bromance, this one's for you.This film is easily the best in the trilogy, blending sharp pacing, humor that actually lands, and action sequences that never feel forced. The weird yet charming dynamic between Eddie and Venom is in full swing, and the filmmakers know exactly how to tap into the ridiculous yet endearing relationship that has become the backbone of this series. It's self-aware without feeling desperate for laughs, striking a balance that's tough to nail in superhero movies these days.While some of the gore pushes the limits of PG-13, it's never gratuitous. There's enough bite to the violence to keep you hooked, but it stops short of being overwhelming. If anything, it adds a little edge to an otherwise slick, polished blockbuster.But the real kicker here is that, amidst all the chaos, Venom: The Last Dance sneaks in some genuine emotion. It's a film about keeping your best bro close, and somehow that works. So why all the hate? It's a popcorn flick that knows exactly what it is, and honestly, that's rare these days.",Positive
973,Almost the whole cast was full. The only cast members that helped was the family and of course the store lady. Mulligan was boring . I felt there was a power struggle when writing this. One wanted to show ase strong women yet made them look stupied and to emotional; while the other smart men but utterly useless in the long run causing more havoc and not thinking before moving.The CGI are as ok. The one creatures could have been way way more creative for sure.Over all it's a lack luster film unfortunately 😕..there's so much they could have done with Tom and this story line. We needed a version of him and Spider man yet have been robbed of that.,Negative
974,"First and foremost, it felt like the makers made every poor decision possible when it came to the sound tracks and music. That which is supposed to amplify the intensity of ride simply let it remain bland throughout, even the climax, even the falling action.With Venom and Eddie having largely ceased their bickering, their bromance has dwindled significantly in this movie. Being the conclusional piece of this hilarious trilogy, it has fallen short of many expectations.Of course there was some of those promised action as witnessed in the trailers. But was there something which swept me off my feet which was absent from the trailers? Not really.While the villain's back-story is rather solid, it could have been more centre-stage. Most of the characters that have made appearance in this movie felt weakly woven together; though the plot could not have moved forward without their roles, they barely left any impact. Speaking of the plot, it largely remains uneventful, with the makers just throwing a few name-sake 3D effect villainous creatures at our faces. There is only one major action sequence throughout the film, that it low-key has bottled down to something I would either skim through, or watch at a slightly increased playback speed.If the unnecessary scenes, and by that I mean, 'adding no humor or value to the plot' scenes were deleted, it could easily boil down to half its current run-time. That being said, there could definitely be leads from where this movie has left loose ends at, but presently, it stays far aloof from being involved in such a gifting.I feel like the last of the trilogy has not done justice to the previous two movies, it almost feels like watching a different character. The ending in particular came off to me as a tryhard terrific ending, and even if the clips were good, the track choices really did not work out for me.",Negative
975,"Eddie and Venom are on the run as fugitives after their battle with Carnage. They are chased by military force and aliens that want to capture them for their codex to unleash a greater evil in their world. Eddie and Venom venture out for a while avoiding authorities and the alien species.I am a fan of the first Venom movie. It is not a well-made movie, but it is so entertaining because of Tom Hardy's crazy performance in both roles and the wacky humor throughout the film. The second movie is much better made mainly because of Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris, but I actually enjoyed the first one more on a fun level. I was pretty excited for the third film and the trailers had me hooked. Does this trilogy end on a memorable last dance?I have mixed thoughts on Venom: The Last Dance. Let's start with the good. I love Eddie and Venom's dynamic and they are at their best in this movie. They have fun chemistry and banter and it feels like they are finally starting to get along with each other a bit better. They also have a few emotional moments that can come off as cheesy, but they have charm especially one scene where Eddie reassures Martin's son that his alien friend is there to help and Venom thanks the kid for a piece of chocolate. In a movie filled with silly moments and action-packed battles, it is a really sweet moment that shows how heroic Eddie and Venom have become.It helps that Tom Hardy is an absolute joy to watch. Hardy relishes in both of his roles and he never lets up. There are several moments of him doing stuff like going crazy at the slot machine and creating a drink at the bar by himself in a quick way. He also handles the more dramatic scenes very well making the more emotional moments work better than they should have.Also, Venom is a very cool character here. He is funny, his powers are awesome and he does anything to protect Eddie even knowing that if they are both alive the aliens will track them down because they have a codex. Venom's antics are very endearing and it seems like he just wants to join the fun and even tries to get Eddie to join in. I love watching him take control of other animals such as a horse, a fish and a frog. Venom is so much fun to watch and he is a good reason why I enjoy these movies despite their faults.The humor is for the most part pretty good. There is one gag that I cringed at but other than that, I got several laughs out of this movie. The banter between Eddie and Venom never gets old for me.The action scenes are pretty entertaining. The chase scene in the river is a standout because it looks cool, it has Eddie Brock defend himself without Venom and Venom turning into other creatures. It is also frenetic and fun to see play out. The climax is also big full of cool moments, but it is a little CGI heavy. However, it features Venom on a motorcycle again and it looks great. Overall, I enjoyed the action.The cinematography by Fabian Wagner is solid and colorful. The lighting is also on point with all of the scenes being lit well enough to see while having some flare in the shots. This is by far the best looking Venom movie filmmaking wise. The special effects are more polished and the alien creatures chasing Venom and Eddie look very menacing. Honestly, they kind of remind me of the Kaijus from Pacific Rim and I like that. There also other symbiotes in the film and they look very cool with their designs, but some of their colors blend in. The visuals are not perfect, but they are an upgrade from the last two movies.All that said, there are a few problems I have with this movie. The biggest problem is that the script is overstuffed. I know that there needs to other plot lines to have the story come together, but some of them do not work at all. The scientists subplot is one of the most boring parts of the movie with how slowly paced it is and how the tone shifts from fun to dreary and not the good kind of dreary. The subplot with Martin and his family is okay and has some great moments, but it can drag a little too long.The supporting cast does not hold a candle to Tom Hardy. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Rex Strickland is the best supporting performance, but his character is too unlikable to root for. Dr. Payne is kind of there until the climax. Clark Backo as Sadie Christmas is alright and she does a lot in the climax, but her character does not stand out until then. Rhys Ifans is having a lot of fun in his role as a family man who believes in aliens. While his family may have gotten a little more focus than they should have, Ifans is pretty fun to watch at times. Andy Serkis as Knull is absolutely wasted. He seems like a menacing villain, but he gets little to do aside from getting expository dialogue. By far, the weakest link in the film and wastes Andy Serkis on a limited role.The tone is all over the place. There are moments where this movie acts like a cheesy road trip comedy with Eddie and Venom and then the next scene could be overly serious research about the symbiotes. The movie progressively darker as it goes along and it has some moments that should come off as emotional and while they kind of work because of Tom Hardy's performance and the duo's likability, they feel a bit unearned because of how comedic this series is by now. When Eddie and Venom ponder the life they could have had when in the car with Martin's family, it is hard to feel anything because they have been two goofballs most of the time. Without spoiling anything, ending is a mixed bag for me because it is sad, but not a tearjerker like the movie wants it to be.The musical score by Dan Deacon makes no impression on me. It just sounds like generic music from any other movie. The needle drops are okay, but I wish they could find another song than Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. However, the credits song One Last Dance by Tom and Roman Morello and Grandson is really catchy and a great song to end the movie. Also, Maroon 5's Memories has a great needle drop here.Venom: The Last Dance is an entertaining movie. It is not well-made and not even as fun as the first film, but I overall had a pretty good time with the movie despite the many issues it has. I guess I cannot help but find Eddie and Venom a lot of fun to watch. Director Kelly Marcel did a great job with the scenes with those two and with the action scenes, but I think she bit off more than she could chew with the other subplots. If you like the Venom movies, you will probably enjoy this movie but if you never them then this movie will not change your mind.Stay through all of the credits.",Positive
976,"It is genuinely impressive that Sony managed to make the most mediocre trilogy ever with such an iconic character.In terms of enjoyment, Eddie and Venom continue to be a delightfully fun duo. In this 3rd movie, they are basically on a road trip and that was relatively entertaining for the most part. The final act of the movie was also a pretty enjoyable CGI action fest with some emotional scenes.However, the story and script are still as flat as ever. The narrative feels very half baked with it feeling like a chain of things just randomly happening. Pointless characters that don't add much. Jokes being thrown at you just to see which land. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor characters could have been played by anyone but feels purposely done because they knew fans recognised them from other Marvel projects. The villain Knull looks cool but is just there to be teased for future projects.Overall, it is better than the second film but just on par with the first. It is a mediocre final entry. Sony continues to disappoint with their universe and We all know Venom is coming back somehow. I do worry for Spiderman 4 and hope Sony don't mess that movie in anyway.",Neutral
977,"""Venom: The Last Dance' is a messy buddy road trip in which you must turn your brains off...again.Is it perfect? Nah, far from it. I think there are way too many storylines in here, and the main one got some potential, but it was wasted in typical Sony fashion. The ""Spider-Man 4"" rumors have been blown out of proportion in my opinion, so temper your expectations.The duo between Eddie and Venom is as fun as always. I mean Tom Hardy and the banter between them...I'm sorry, the banter between Hardy and himself is the best part of these movies (Hardy is doing the voice of Venom).The humor is there, but can't say I laughed all that much, beacause most of the jokes are base level childish again. It must be a bit more emotional as a whole, because supposedly is the last time we see Venom (hardly doubt), but it ends up kinda hollow.Knull is there...I guess, but will see how and when they'll use him again...it's Sony after all.It's a popcorn movie that reminds me of the early 2000's comic book movies. The action in the third act is good for the most parts and there are some funny moments here and there. Are there plot holes and some issues with the story? Yes. It's just another ""Turn your brains off"" Sony movie again.There are two credit scenes, first one is kinda important, the second one not so much.",Positive
978,"My relationship with the Venom franchise has been rocky. I have a soft spot for the first one, absolutely loathe the second, and now we come to the trilogy's closer, and thankfully, it's an improvement.Venom: The Last Dance works best when it focuses on Eddie and Venom's story instead of trying to set up the future of the Sonyverse. If you didn't like the previous Venom films, this won't change your mind. It's still messy, but it gets more right than its predecessors.This is easily the campiest and most mature of the bunch. It takes its time with the characters, letting us sit with them instead of rushing into the next action set piece. Still being PG-13 it manages to cram in a lot more gore than its predecessors. The action is inventive, and the humor hits its mark. It also doesn't shy away from getting personal and emotional. Eddie and Venom's relationship has never felt more genuine. I'll admit-I teared up a few times by the end.Some may be disappointed by the potrayal of Knull, but personally, I loved it. He feels like an overlooming threat rather than an one-off villain, and the ""God of Darkness"" gets a Thanos-esque treatment he deserves.Now, don't get me wrong-the movie is still bad, technically speaking-but it's self-aware about that. Instead of being ""bad bad,"" it chooses to be ""fun bad"" and entertain you, and I respect that. Not every movie needs to be great; sometimes being fun is enough.Even with the lows, I have always found a weird sense of comfort with this rendition of Venom. I have found myself caring more for these characters than maybe even the script intended. So I am happy to say that by the end, it does enough to justify this trilogy's existence - and to such an satisfying extent that I'd rather live in a world where the Venom movies exist than one where it doesn't.",Positive
979,"The third installment about the symbiotic anti-hero is a mix of bright moments and disappointments. Tom Hardy once again proves why he is the perfect choice for the role of Eddie Brock/Venom, but even his charismatic performance cannot save the unbalanced ensemble. The film starts off promisingly - with dynamic action and witty dialogue between Eddie and his symbiotic companion. Their relationship is still the best the series has to offer. Hardy brilliantly manages both comedic timing and dramatic moments. The visual effects are impressive in places, especially in the action sequences where Venom shows off his abilities. At other times, however, the CGI feels inadequate and more reminiscent of a video game from the last decade. Some fights are well choreographed, others are a chaotic mix of digital effects. The biggest problem is the script, which tries to be too ambitious. It mixes several storylines, introduces new characters and antagonists, but does not give them enough space to develop. The result is a rushed pace and superficial characters. The film's darker tone is a welcome change, but it often clashes with the comedic elements, creating an unbalanced whole. The film seems unsure whether it wants to be a serious drama or a lighthearted entertainment. Venom: The Last Dance is like a roller coaster - it's ups and downs. For fans of the series, it offers enough fun, but it's hard to call it a significant step forward. This film is like an average song on a great album, but as a whole it doesn't leave a strong impression. Fans will find their own, others may be disappointed.",Positive
980,"Maybe it's just because of my low expectations toward the series but it was just fun to watch. I've already lost hope for the trilogy to have a decent plot but I can say that this one has a better storyline than the second film.CGI was fine, I coudn't find any disturbing point. It was interesting to see the other symbiotes. I think those new symbiotes showed more symbiote-ish action scenes than venom when it comes to the fight ironically.There were a few funny jokes that made me laugh but I didn't really find Eddie's weird obsession for shoes funny, like was it supposed to be funny? Guess it was meant to be humor but well... it was almost tiring.",Neutral
981,"A solid enough send off for this 'Venom' trilogy.'Venom: The Last Dance' is decently amusing and produces enough entertainment with its plot. I didn't personally find it overly funny, though the person a few seats across from me had an absolute blast - never a bad thing seeing people enjoy themselves!Tom Hardy remains the key element of these films, they would be far less enjoyable without his presence. There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor stick out most from the other characters.",Negative

983,"Being Rated R probably would have saved this; I am just saying!This trilogy-capper almost makes me question if I have become more of a movie critic than a movie enjoyer. Then I remembered this is Sony's Spider-Man Universe we are talking about, which gave us films like ""Morbius"" and ""Madame Web."" I nonetheless went in here with an open mind, considering I do not mind the two previous ""Venom"" films that came out. After seeing ""The Last Dance,"" I question whether Sony was trying to set up their universe or give Eddie Brock and Venom the send-off they deserve. I am sadly leaning more toward the former.I should preface this review by telling you what I thought of the other two ""Venom"" films upon rewatch in preparation for this third installment. Those were entertaining yet disappointing superhero films saved by the performance of Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and Venom. The first was innocent enough, with a dull first and more engaging second half, a weak villain in Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake/Riot, exciting action, and Hardy performing nicely. Its sequel, ""Let There Be Carnage,"" surprisingly got better when revisiting it, easily surpassing its predecessor, with Hardy allowed to stretch his comedic abilities with Brock and Venom bickering hilariously. In addition, there is Woody Harrelson's enjoyable performance as Cletus Kasady/Carnage, who manages to rise above the flaws, including the disappointing inclusion of Naomie Harris' Frances Barrison/Shriek. Hardy was allowed to have fun with his characters, and the movies complimented him with a narrative that was not too complicated. The opposite is true for ""The Last Dance.""Let's get the positives out of the way first. It is a short list, which I am deeply saddened by, but I want to show you how it is not the worst superhero film out there or even the worst film of the year.Despite a woeful screenplay, Tom Hardy still does skillfully with Eddie Brock and Venom. He is not allowed to have as much fun as he did in the prior two films, but he is trying his best (right, the positives. Sorry).The rest of the cast delivered equally solid performances, with the other standout being Chiwetel Ejiofor as Orwell Taylor. Ejiofor always has a commanding presence whenever he is in a movie, with his characters of Baron Mordo in the two ""Doctor Strange"" films and Bathurst 2020 in the forgettable ""Infinite"" being the two I can think of at the top of my head. Even if the film is not the best, Ejiofor makes it work, and if it is fantastic, he always steals the show.The visual effects bring Venom and the other alien characters to gorgeous life. The other two ""Venom"" movies, granted, had remarkable CGI, but it is worth mentioning, specifically when discussing the positives.The action is somewhat fun. The ""Venom"" movies have always had enjoyable action. Unfortunately, ""The Last Dance"" was the least fun action-wise, but the first scene with action was sweet.The Venom symbiote is sometimes uniquely utilized. The trailers showcased Venom controlling a horse, and in the film, it is one of its best scenes. I am unsure if this is a spoiler, but he controls other animals, and they introduce other symbiotes, which is fun.I think that is it for the positives.I felt the portrayal of Eddie Brock and Venom this time was not good. Again, Hardy tried, but there were multiple times when it felt like he was bored. His character was, admittedly, bored at intervals, and Hardy is a screenwriter, but I am saying how it felt.The film tries to add new characters, but they are not compelling. The most obvious example is Dr. Payne, played by Juno Temple, who does nothing aside from believing that Brock is not a danger, while Ejiofor wants what is best for the world, considering the alien threat from Knull.Speaking of Knull, he was worse than Carlton Drake. He only sends alien minions to grab a MacGuffin that Venom has. I have not read the comics, but the impression I get from others and this movie is that Knull has a profound lore not represented here. Having Knull's alien pals and the Area 51 agents as the villains is too much, yet somehow too little.They also wasted Stephen Graham's Detective Mulligan. The trailers made it seem like Mulligan would be a principal and intriguing character. The only two interesting aspects about Mulligan are he has a symbiote and warns of Knull. That is it.Furthermore, it does not have that much comedy. ""Let There Be Carnage"" can easily be classified as a comedy, and I laughed more than I would like to admit. I think two laughs and three to five chuckles were all I had here. The film was not funny outside of the Venom horse and some banter between Brock and Venom.On top of that, there was not that much emotion. It is due to how much Brock and Venom were not well utilized and the clutter of characters. I did not care about the Area 51 personnel nor the unnamed family who brought Brock and Venom to Vegas. When the ending came along, which heightened the stakes to an unbelievable degree, I did not get emotional. It tried, but it failed to work.The other two ""Venom"" movies were entertaining, but this failed to come close. In an era where ""superhero fatigue"" is becoming more accepted, this trilogy-closer did not try anything new. Fascinating concepts here and there, and many standout scenes fail to save this disappointment in a franchise filled with them.Technically, a 6/10. Outside of the plot and the underwhelming screenplay, the visual effects remain exceptional, the actors did great, and the film functions.For the enjoyment score, I wanted to like this film. I had the sneaking suspicion that it might not work, but watching ""Let There Be Carnage"" increase in quality gave me hope. It was no ""Let There Be Carnage"" and is easily the weakest of the trilogy. It had the issues that plagued the likes of ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but does not come close to being as entertaining as them. I am so unhappy that the enjoyment score is a 4/10, but this trilogy deserved a better conclusion. Maybe it will get better when I watch it again, but as it stands, it is best for me to recommend you wait until Netflix or even Disney+.",Positive
984,"This movie was very middle of the road to me. Definitely better than the second one, but not as good as the original.I enjoyed the beginning very much. Nice pace, good story and funny at times. Also the last part was packed with action and it all looked amazing. Only thing I missed was some sort of a climax at the very end.The middle however, I did not care for too much. Some things felt forced, rushed and very unlikely. But as I often say in my reviews: 'It is a fictional, fantasy, action movie so who cares if some things do not add up.'As a whole I enjoyed it very much, Tom Hardy did not disappoint.",Positive
985,"I just don't get it, I thought the 1st Venom was good despite many fans may not have liked it. I'm not a comic fan, so for me it was good that they try to make it as relatable and realistic to just your average movie goer.The 2nd film was cringy and terrible in my opinion because the story didn't make much sense, too much drama, poetry, and bromance. I lost interest after watching that one but the trailer for this film looked good.Right from the beginning I realize this was going to be bad. I don't care about the multi-verse, I don't care about Knull, I don't care about all these comic lores. The story is completely unrelatable and the suspension of disbelief failed early on.And then to top it off, the ending was just awful.4/10 for the special effects. Everything else is a 0.",Negative
986,"If you've already come to terms with this version of Venom and Eddie Brock as more of a bromance than the savage, brutal duo from the comics, you're in for a fun ride, Venom: The Last Dance, the final chapter of the trilogy, delivers an entertaining ride with solid pacing, good performances, decent visual effects, and fun engaging enough story, added also with the joy of let all the madness fan service out makes Venom: The Last Dance an easy good time especially for me, even the serious part mostly with Chiwetel Ejiofor was executed pretty well, surprising wholesome moments with Rhys Ifans and his family characters, flawed? Sure, some of the editing cuts didn't quite work for me, there were a few cheesy, awkward moments that felt off, and nit picky here and there, overall, i have a good time with Venom: The Last Dance, and the most surprising thing also the least thing i could expect watching this supposed to be last time we'll see both Venom and Eddie was that i did get quite emotional at the end, it's clear they've evolved from mere host and symbiote to something much deeper, and their dynamic was surprisingly touching, my personal experience with these two also comes as long as these three movies together, and as the movie itself whether it's better than the first one which also a good movie in my opinion, The Last Dance succeeded my expectation from being far from bad, i want this goodbye to be at least watchable enough, and the result is more than that, Venom: The Last Dance is actually a good film, just like Venom would say, We are Venom, and this film makes sure we feel it.",Negative
987,"Fun, wild, and hot mess. There's too much plot that's never explained. Events just happen randomly with no payoff, with a big action scene towards the end. Eddie & Venom Bromance is the savior of this trilogy. If you enjoy the others you will enjoy this.Synopsis:
In Venom: The Last Dance, Tom Hardy returns as Venom, one of Marvel's greatest and most complex characters, for the final film in the trilogy. Eddie and Venom are on the run. Hunted by both of their worlds and with the net closing in, the duo are forced into a devastating decision that will bring the curtains down on Venom and Eddie's last dance.",Positive
988,"If you were hoping for a grand finale to the Venom franchise that would surpass the comedic heights of its predecessors, you're in for a letdown. While Venom: The Last Dance does deliver on the comedic front, it falls short in nearly every other aspect.The film picks up right where we left off, with Eddie Brock and Venom still on the run. The plot takes a convoluted turn as they become embroiled in a government conspiracy involving symbiotes and a dangerous threat to the universe. While the premise is intriguing, the execution feels rushed and often confusing.The real draw of this film, as with its predecessors, is the chemistry between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom. Their banter and witty exchanges provide much-needed humor and keep the film entertaining. However, the comedic elements can feel forced at times, and the overall tone can be uneven.The film's biggest flaw is its reliance on poor CGI and even worse dialogue. The visual effects, particularly those involving the titular symbiote, often feel like a step back from previous entries. Venom's appearances are fleeting, and when he does appear in full form, he's often overshadowed by lackluster animation.The script is equally disappointing. The story lacks depth and originality, and the characters feel one-dimensional. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the pacing feels uneven. While there are a few moments of humor that might elicit a chuckle, they're not enough to salvage the film.Ultimately, Venom: The Last Dance is a missed opportunity. It's a shame that such a potentially fun franchise has ended on such a sour note.",Negative
989,"If cinematic catastrophes could have a mascot, this would be standing at the front of the line, waving its tattered flag of mediocrity. Tom Hardy's final outing as Eddie Brock/Venom is not just a disappointment-it's an insult to audiences everywhere. To call this movie bad would be a kindness. This is an incoherent, muddled, and utterly joyless mess that somehow manages to fall short of even the lowest expectations.The premise of Eddie and Venom being ""on the run"" from both worlds promised at least some thrilling action. Instead, what we get is a chaotic, poorly-scripted nightmare of disjointed scenes and absurd plot holes big enough to swallow the entire Marvel universe. The narrative, if you can call it that, lurches forward with all the grace of a drunken man stumbling in the dark. There is no rhyme or reason to the events that unfold. It's like the writers cobbled together every half-baked idea they could think of and hoped nobody would notice how little sense any of it makes.The so-called ""devastating decision"" that Eddie and Venom face feels less like a culmination of their journey and more like a cheap, hollow ploy to yank on the audience's emotions. But even that attempt falls flat because, by the time it arrives, the viewer is too exhausted from enduring 90 minutes of mindless drivel to care.Eddie Brock, once a complex and conflicted anti-hero from the source comics, is reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self, mumbling and stumbling through the film like he just wants to get it over with.The supporting characters are even worse-if that's possible. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use cardboard cutouts of side characters nobody cares about and clearly has no understanding of what made the earlier films (barely) work.They serve no purpose other than to waste screen time and remind us that, yes, someone actually wrote this drivel down on paper.It wouldn't be a Venom movie without over-the-top CGI battles, right? Well, unfortunately, the action scenes here are so poorly executed and short to save cost that even those who came purely for mindless entertainment will leave disappointed. The special effects are a headache-inducing blur of dark, indistinguishable shapes smashing into each other, with zero sense of tension or creativity.The final fight scene feels like -an unintelligible swirl of chaos that is supposed to distract us from the fact that nothing of consequence is happening. It's not exciting, it's not entertaining, it's just ugly.At its core it tries to sell itself as a dramatic, emotional farewell to Eddie and Venom's bond, but it doesn't even come close to achieving that. Any attempt at emotional weight is drowned by the film's clumsy pacing and complete lack of character development. The so-called ""devastating"" decision feels unearned, forced, and utterly unconvincing. There is no sense of closure, no satisfying payoff-just a hollow, empty finale that leaves you wondering why you wasted your time in the first place.Avoid this movie like the symbiote plague it is. Eddie and Venom deserved better. We all deserved better.Tom's ego and nepotism to promote his FWB director both of whom had sole credit of writing the script should tell you that how much he actually despises the franchise.Tom was the ultimate culprit is giving the first movie it's comic tone and had heated arguments with Ruben Flesicher on set to such an extent that filming halted for a few days. There were 3 script writers on the first movie can you guess who was one of them?It's the director of this movie who with her relationship strong armed and hijacked the plot elements and forced to introduce the comic tone into the first movie by reshooting the movie which had resulted in a disjointed mess.Even the Ruben had expressed his deep regrets about that but I guess if you can control the leading star you can have your way.If you closely look at the tone of the first movie first trailer you will notice the horror and science fiction elements present which had been stripped down to barebones and gag and quips reigned supreme.",Negative
990,"My wife and I watched Venom: The Last Dance (2024) last night in theaters. The storyline follows Eddie Brock, who is on the run from the law and hiding in Mexico. When an invasion from Venom's home world begins, Eddie must make his way to Area 51 to find reinforcements and fight off the invaders.Directed by Kelly Marcel in her directorial debut, the film stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Rhys Ifans (The Amazing Spider-Man), Stephen Graham (Snatch), and Juno Temple (Killer Joe).I absolutely loved the first two-thirds of this film. Tom Hardy nailed his role, bringing a perfect blend of humor, action, and Venom's signature appetite for chaos. The various forms Venom takes are visually entertaining, and the self-deprecating humor is spot-on. We especially enjoyed the introduction of a quirky ""hippie family,"" who added a fun twist. However, once the story shifts to Area 51, things feel rushed and forced. The other symbiotes look incredible, but they come and go so quickly that you're left wanting more. The villain's defeat also felt underwhelming, and I wanted a bit more depth in their storyline. The homage at the end felt somewhat awkward as well.In conclusion, Venom: The Last Dance is a fun watch and definitely worth seeing for fans of the character, though it doesn't quite reach its full potential. I'd rate it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Positive

992,"Venom 3 is fun movie. It will never be critically rated, but it doesn't need or try to be. It is fun, it is weird, it looks good and the interactions between Eddie and Venom are great as always and are funny unlike the forced jokes that don't always land. We get to see a bit more of the rest of the symbiotes, but it is not a major focus of the movie to introduce or highlight them, which was a bit disappointing personally. The storyline is a bit messy, and there are a few plotholes and illogical, unexplainable events, but the movie does a good job of actually taking the viewers through it. We get and ending to the trilogy that is pretty much what you expect, but the emotional charge of it feels a bit forced and doesn't let the viewer appreciate it for themselves. We also get a glimpse of what may come in the future, including a namedrop that comic fans will get, so we may see more of our goofy antihero in the future.",Positive
993,"Venom The Last Dance was hilarious, emotional and entertaining. Went in with the same expectations as before very low. I'm shocked about the critics, cause they expected much more unreal scenarios. Here again Sony is not stupid of course they'd have added a specific character in their world, but they probably can't because of a certain contract clause. The third movie is much better than the second cause the second movie suffered from extreme cuts which took out all its potential. Despite the fact that Venom was rumored and in productions ever since early 00s it's no wonder they made a trilogy and had box office success, cause Tom Hardy carried those movies on his own. Every other actor wouldn't be able to pull out this great chemistry between him and Venom. I'm not biased I see its flaws and weaknesses, but my God some critics thrashed this movie as if it's another Morbius or Madame Web. It's by far a better movie.The road trip family was adorable not necessary but there to add a more family atmosphere and emotional touch to this film. Juno Temple was good but underperformed and here background story was dragged into this movie.Ms Cheng was probably the best positive highlight of the movie besides the love for dogs and animals in general.A lot of great symbionts and designs were actually great to watch. I can't say much more to that point cause I want to avoid spoilers.The issuesThe plot and goal of the movie is clear but gets lost through the movie. The action sequences and CGI were average at best. I know that sounds awful for a higher rating, but hear me out. The cast was decent and some actors really shined here.Another problem is the camera work here too many fast cuts hardly to see specially when I think I was obligated to watch it in 3D. I prefer 2D.The biggest problem was there is no clear 1 v 1 villain here with heart and intentions. We have Knull as the big bad in the background but barely seen but only to bait us fans to watch it and another mystery character from the army or swat like crew not shown at all. Where as the first two movies had clear antagonists shown.Issue / or averageThe Ending was emotional and impactful with rushed bangs, but man there were some scenes I really felt touched by it. I still think they could've done more and Tom deserved more !I give it 6 but as a trilogy part and the Tom Hardy factor a light 7, cause reviews between 1-4 stars are harsh. And yeah don't leave there are two important post credit scenes. I'm really looking forward !",Positive

995,"Barely emotional. Barely funny. Barely mediocre. From this pattern, it can be deducted that Venom: The Last Dance is a passable movie that doesn't do enough right to feel like an epic send off, or do anything inherently wrong to be worth complaining about. It's just fine.Tom Hardy is once again the easy stand-out as Eddie Brock, using the same janky physical actions as Venom manipulates his movements to an entertaining degree. The humour is the same safe but fine lines of dialogue that either evoke a chuckle or short exhale of breath. The action scenes escalate in levels of excitement throughout the film, with the final act especially delivering some really fun mayhem. And being the supposed final film of the trilogy, there are some surprisingly tender moments sprinkled in, but aren't frequent enough to draw any real emotion.As aforementioned, the humour is fine but there's one particular segment of the film in Las Vegas that feels too ridiculous and reckless in the context of the movie. Moreover, the story sets up rules that either get contradicted, forgotten, or straight up ignored for the sake of 'cool' scenes. Aside from Eddie and Venom, the rest of the cast of characters come off as either underutilised, underdeveloped, or unnecessary. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rhys Ifans feel criminally wasted, Juno Temple and Clark Backo undermine each other as their characters could've been just compiled into one due to their similar traits, and Stephen Graham and Peggy Lu don't do much to feel properly utilised, especially Graham, who's character felt like was building up to a bigger pay-off than what we got. And the antagonist Knull was so sidelined that there's not much more to say about him other than 'he was in the movie'.In conclusion, for what Venom: The Last Dance can't deliver in a concise plot or compelling side characters, it manages to make up for it with fun symbiote action and mostly entertaining and semi-heartfelt sequences.",Negative
996,"Sony should publicly apologise to the audience for making this worst movie and make the audience suffer and wasted their time. So boring story, nothing to appreciate only actor (Tom Hardy) has done, good acting Else, everyone, not done anything to discuss, that's why am giving one star.Don't waste your money by going into the theatres. CGI was good, but story was so pathetic. You can just guess the whole picture by trailer waste of money. Tom Hardy should try superhero movies with other Studios sony is not good with superheroes. We have already seen this with Superman. Middle part was so boring and ending was too predictable.",Negative
997,"Venom: The Last Dance delivers exactly what it promises-an absurdly fun, high-octane ride with a surprising amount of heart. If you expected Avengers: Endgame level of finality, you walked into the wrong theater, but for those who wanted a dumb but entertaining alien-human bromance, this one's for you.This film is easily the best in the trilogy, blending sharp pacing, humor that actually lands, and action sequences that never feel forced. The weird yet charming dynamic between Eddie and Venom is in full swing, and the filmmakers know exactly how to tap into the ridiculous yet endearing relationship that has become the backbone of this series. It's self-aware without feeling desperate for laughs, striking a balance that's tough to nail in superhero movies these days.While some of the gore pushes the limits of PG-13, it's never gratuitous. There's enough bite to the violence to keep you hooked, but it stops short of being overwhelming. If anything, it adds a little edge to an otherwise slick, polished blockbuster.But the real kicker here is that, amidst all the chaos, Venom: The Last Dance sneaks in some genuine emotion. It's a film about keeping your best bro close, and somehow that works. So why all the hate? It's a popcorn flick that knows exactly what it is, and honestly, that's rare these days.",Positive
998,Almost the whole cast was full. The only cast members that helped was the family and of course the store lady. Mulligan was boring . I felt there was a power struggle when writing this. One wanted to show ase strong women yet made them look stupied and to emotional; while the other smart men but utterly useless in the long run causing more havoc and not thinking before moving.The CGI are as ok. The one creatures could have been way way more creative for sure.Over all it's a lack luster film unfortunately 😕..there's so much they could have done with Tom and this story line. We needed a version of him and Spider man yet have been robbed of that.,Negative
999,"First and foremost, it felt like the makers made every poor decision possible when it came to the sound tracks and music. That which is supposed to amplify the intensity of ride simply let it remain bland throughout, even the climax, even the falling action.With Venom and Eddie having largely ceased their bickering, their bromance has dwindled significantly in this movie. Being the conclusional piece of this hilarious trilogy, it has fallen short of many expectations.Of course there was some of those promised action as witnessed in the trailers. But was there something which swept me off my feet which was absent from the trailers? Not really.While the villain's back-story is rather solid, it could have been more centre-stage. Most of the characters that have made appearance in this movie felt weakly woven together; though the plot could not have moved forward without their roles, they barely left any impact. Speaking of the plot, it largely remains uneventful, with the makers just throwing a few name-sake 3D effect villainous creatures at our faces. There is only one major action sequence throughout the film, that it low-key has bottled down to something I would either skim through, or watch at a slightly increased playback speed.If the unnecessary scenes, and by that I mean, 'adding no humor or value to the plot' scenes were deleted, it could easily boil down to half its current run-time. That being said, there could definitely be leads from where this movie has left loose ends at, but presently, it stays far aloof from being involved in such a gifting.I feel like the last of the trilogy has not done justice to the previous two movies, it almost feels like watching a different character. The ending in particular came off to me as a tryhard terrific ending, and even if the clips were good, the track choices really did not work out for me.",Negative
1000,"Eddie and Venom are on the run as fugitives after their battle with Carnage. They are chased by military force and aliens that want to capture them for their codex to unleash a greater evil in their world. Eddie and Venom venture out for a while avoiding authorities and the alien species.I am a fan of the first Venom movie. It is not a well-made movie, but it is so entertaining because of Tom Hardy's crazy performance in both roles and the wacky humor throughout the film. The second movie is much better made mainly because of Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris, but I actually enjoyed the first one more on a fun level. I was pretty excited for the third film and the trailers had me hooked. Does this trilogy end on a memorable last dance?I have mixed thoughts on Venom: The Last Dance. Let's start with the good. I love Eddie and Venom's dynamic and they are at their best in this movie. They have fun chemistry and banter and it feels like they are finally starting to get along with each other a bit better. They also have a few emotional moments that can come off as cheesy, but they have charm especially one scene where Eddie reassures Martin's son that his alien friend is there to help and Venom thanks the kid for a piece of chocolate. In a movie filled with silly moments and action-packed battles, it is a really sweet moment that shows how heroic Eddie and Venom have become.It helps that Tom Hardy is an absolute joy to watch. Hardy relishes in both of his roles and he never lets up. There are several moments of him doing stuff like going crazy at the slot machine and creating a drink at the bar by himself in a quick way. He also handles the more dramatic scenes very well making the more emotional moments work better than they should have.Also, Venom is a very cool character here. He is funny, his powers are awesome and he does anything to protect Eddie even knowing that if they are both alive the aliens will track them down because they have a codex. Venom's antics are very endearing and it seems like he just wants to join the fun and even tries to get Eddie to join in. I love watching him take control of other animals such as a horse, a fish and a frog. Venom is so much fun to watch and he is a good reason why I enjoy these movies despite their faults.The humor is for the most part pretty good. There is one gag that I cringed at but other than that, I got several laughs out of this movie. The banter between Eddie and Venom never gets old for me.The action scenes are pretty entertaining. The chase scene in the river is a standout because it looks cool, it has Eddie Brock defend himself without Venom and Venom turning into other creatures. It is also frenetic and fun to see play out. The climax is also big full of cool moments, but it is a little CGI heavy. However, it features Venom on a motorcycle again and it looks great. Overall, I enjoyed the action.The cinematography by Fabian Wagner is solid and colorful. The lighting is also on point with all of the scenes being lit well enough to see while having some flare in the shots. This is by far the best looking Venom movie filmmaking wise. The special effects are more polished and the alien creatures chasing Venom and Eddie look very menacing. Honestly, they kind of remind me of the Kaijus from Pacific Rim and I like that. There also other symbiotes in the film and they look very cool with their designs, but some of their colors blend in. The visuals are not perfect, but they are an upgrade from the last two movies.All that said, there are a few problems I have with this movie. The biggest problem is that the script is overstuffed. I know that there needs to other plot lines to have the story come together, but some of them do not work at all. The scientists subplot is one of the most boring parts of the movie with how slowly paced it is and how the tone shifts from fun to dreary and not the good kind of dreary. The subplot with Martin and his family is okay and has some great moments, but it can drag a little too long.The supporting cast does not hold a candle to Tom Hardy. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Rex Strickland is the best supporting performance, but his character is too unlikable to root for. Dr. Payne is kind of there until the climax. Clark Backo as Sadie Christmas is alright and she does a lot in the climax, but her character does not stand out until then. Rhys Ifans is having a lot of fun in his role as a family man who believes in aliens. While his family may have gotten a little more focus than they should have, Ifans is pretty fun to watch at times. Andy Serkis as Knull is absolutely wasted. He seems like a menacing villain, but he gets little to do aside from getting expository dialogue. By far, the weakest link in the film and wastes Andy Serkis on a limited role.The tone is all over the place. There are moments where this movie acts like a cheesy road trip comedy with Eddie and Venom and then the next scene could be overly serious research about the symbiotes. The movie progressively darker as it goes along and it has some moments that should come off as emotional and while they kind of work because of Tom Hardy's performance and the duo's likability, they feel a bit unearned because of how comedic this series is by now. When Eddie and Venom ponder the life they could have had when in the car with Martin's family, it is hard to feel anything because they have been two goofballs most of the time. Without spoiling anything, ending is a mixed bag for me because it is sad, but not a tearjerker like the movie wants it to be.The musical score by Dan Deacon makes no impression on me. It just sounds like generic music from any other movie. The needle drops are okay, but I wish they could find another song than Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. However, the credits song One Last Dance by Tom and Roman Morello and Grandson is really catchy and a great song to end the movie. Also, Maroon 5's Memories has a great needle drop here.Venom: The Last Dance is an entertaining movie. It is not well-made and not even as fun as the first film, but I overall had a pretty good time with the movie despite the many issues it has. I guess I cannot help but find Eddie and Venom a lot of fun to watch. Director Kelly Marcel did a great job with the scenes with those two and with the action scenes, but I think she bit off more than she could chew with the other subplots. If you like the Venom movies, you will probably enjoy this movie but if you never them then this movie will not change your mind.Stay through all of the credits.",Positive
1001,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",Positive

1003,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",Positive
1004,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",Positive
1005,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",Positive
1006,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.",Positive

NOW.",Positive
1009,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!",Positive

1011,"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",Positive

1013,"This must be the most overrated film of the year.Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.There are far too many characters.Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",Positive
1014,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",Neutral
1015,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",Neutral
1016,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",Positive
1017,"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough.",Positive
1018,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.",Positive
1019,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",Positive

Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue.",Neutral
1022,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",Positive
1023,"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped.",Neutral

1026,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",Positive

I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",Positive
1030,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J.

With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",Positive
1031,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.",Positive

Amazing cinematography, Exceptional acting and terrifying Soundtracks.All the cast are great from cilian Murphy who is going for the oscar with this role to Rupert Downey jr and Emily blunt and finally rami malik who has small scenes but you will never forget them.I didn't watch it in Imax as i couldn't wait and ran to the nearest cinema but now i will sure book an imax ticket.Don't waste any time, book your ticket and Go watch it.. NOW.",Positive
1034,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!",Positive

1036,"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",Positive

1038,"This must be the most overrated film of the year.Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.There are far too many characters.Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",Positive
1039,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",Neutral
1040,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",Neutral
1041,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",Positive
1042,"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough.",Positive
1043,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.",Positive
1044,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",Positive

Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue.",Neutral
1047,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",Positive
1048,"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped.",Neutral
1049,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",Positive

1051,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",Positive

1053,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",Positive
1054,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",Positive
1055,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",Positive
1056,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.",Positive

1058,"I may consider myself lucky to be alive to watch Christopher Nolan Works which get better by years.Oppenheimer is - with no doubt- going to be one of the best movies in the history. Amazing cinematography, Exceptional acting and terrifying Soundtracks.All the cast are great from cilian Murphy who is going for the oscar with this role to Rupert Downey jr and Emily blunt and finally rami malik who has small scenes but you will never forget them.I didn't watch it in Imax as i couldn't wait and ran to the nearest cinema but now i will sure book an imax ticket.Don't waste any time, book your ticket and Go watch it.. NOW.",Positive
1059,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!",Positive

1061,"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",Positive

1063,"This must be the most overrated film of the year.Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.There are far too many characters.Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",Positive
1064,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",Neutral
1065,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",Neutral
1066,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",Positive
1067,"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough.",Positive
1068,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.",Positive
1069,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",Positive

Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue.",Neutral
1072,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",Positive
1073,"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped.",Neutral
1074,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",Positive

1076,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",Positive

1078,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",Positive
1079,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",Positive
1080,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",Positive

1083,"I may consider myself lucky to be alive to watch Christopher Nolan Works which get better by years.Oppenheimer is - with no doubt- going to be one of the best movies in the history. Amazing cinematography, Exceptional acting and terrifying Soundtracks.All the cast are great from cilian Murphy who is going for the oscar with this role to Rupert Downey jr and Emily blunt and finally rami malik who has small scenes but you will never forget them.I didn't watch it in Imax as i couldn't wait and ran to the nearest cinema but now i will sure book an imax ticket.Don't waste any time, book your ticket and Go watch it.. NOW.",Positive
1084,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!",Positive

1086,"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",Positive

1088,"This must be the most overrated film of the year.Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.There are far too many characters.Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",Positive
1089,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",Neutral
1090,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",Neutral
1091,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",Positive
1092,"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough.",Positive
1093,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.",Positive
1094,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",Positive

1096,"Nolan is back and delivers a fast paced thrilling biopic that will leave you stunned.the cinematography, sound design, score all exceptional. Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue.",Neutral
1097,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",Positive
1098,"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped.",Neutral
1099,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",Positive

1101,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",Positive

1103,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",Positive
1104,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",Positive
1105,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",Positive

I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine .

1111,"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",Positive

1113,"This must be the most overrated film of the year.Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.There are far too many characters.Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",Positive
1114,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",Neutral
1115,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",Neutral
1116,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",Positive
1117,"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough.",Positive
1118,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.",Positive
1119,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",Positive

1121,"Nolan is back and delivers a fast paced thrilling biopic that will leave you stunned.the cinematography, sound design, score all exceptional. Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue.",Neutral
1122,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",Positive
1123,"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped.",Neutral
1124,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",Positive

1126,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",Positive

1128,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",Positive
1129,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",Positive
1130,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",Positive
1131,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine .

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!",Positive

1136,"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",Positive

1138,"This must be the most overrated film of the year.Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.There are far too many characters.Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",Positive
1139,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",Neutral
1140,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",Neutral
1141,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",Positive
1142,"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough.",Positive
1143,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.",Positive
1144,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",Positive

1146,"Nolan is back and delivers a fast paced thrilling biopic that will leave you stunned.the cinematography, sound design, score all exceptional. Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue.",Neutral
1147,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",Positive
1148,"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped.",Neutral
1149,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",Positive

1151,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",Positive

1153,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",Positive
1154,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",Positive
1155,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",Positive
1156,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that .

1159,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!",Positive

1161,"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",Positive

1163,"This must be the most overrated film of the year.Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.There are far too many characters.Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",Positive
1164,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",Neutral
1165,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",Neutral
1166,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",Positive
1167,"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough.",Positive

1169,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",Positive

1171,"Nolan is back and delivers a fast paced thrilling biopic that will leave you stunned.the cinematography, sound design, score all exceptional. Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue.",Neutral
1172,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",Positive
1173,"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped.",Neutral

1176,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",Positive

1178,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",Positive
1179,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",Positive
1180,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",Positive
1181,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that .

1184,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!",Positive

1186,"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",Positive

1188,"This must be the most overrated film of the year.Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.There are far too many characters.Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",Positive
1189,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",Neutral
1190,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",Neutral
1191,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",Positive
1192,"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough.",Positive
1193,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.",Positive
1194,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",Positive

1201,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",Positive

1203,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",Positive
1204,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",Positive
1205,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",Positive
1206,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.",Positive

1209,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!",Positive

1211,"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",Positive

1213,"This must be the most overrated film of the year.Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.There are far too many characters.Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",Positive
1214,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",Neutral
1215,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",Neutral
1216,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",Positive
1217,"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough.",Positive
1218,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.",Positive
1219,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",Positive

Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals.

1222,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",Positive

1226,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",Positive

Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",Positive
1231,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.",Positive

1233,"I may consider myself lucky to be alive to watch Christopher Nolan Works which get better by years.Oppenheimer is - with no doubt- going to be one of the best movies in the history. Amazing cinematography, Exceptional acting and terrifying Soundtracks.All the cast are great from cilian Murphy who is going for the oscar with this role to Rupert Downey jr and Emily blunt and finally rami malik who has small scenes but you will never forget them.I didn't watch it in Imax as i couldn't wait and ran to the nearest cinema but now i will sure book an imax ticket.Don't waste any time, book your ticket and Go watch it.. NOW.",Positive
1234,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!",Positive

1236,"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",Positive

1238,"This must be the most overrated film of the year.Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.There are far too many characters.Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",Positive
1239,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",Neutral
1240,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",Neutral
1241,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",Positive
1242,"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough.",Positive
1243,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.",Positive
1244,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",Positive

Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue.",Neutral
1247,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",Positive
1248,"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped.",Neutral
1249,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",Positive

1251,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",Positive

1253,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",Positive
1254,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",Positive
1255,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",Positive
1256,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.",Positive

Amazing cinematography, Exceptional acting and terrifying Soundtracks.All the cast are great from cilian Murphy who is going for the oscar with this role to Rupert Downey jr and Emily blunt and finally rami malik who has small scenes but you will never forget them.I didn't watch it in Imax as i couldn't wait and ran to the nearest cinema but now i will sure book an imax ticket.Don't waste any time, book your ticket and Go watch it.. NOW.",Positive
1259,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!",Positive

1261,"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",Positive

1263,"This must be the most overrated film of the year.Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.There are far too many characters.Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",Positive
1264,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",Neutral
1265,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",Neutral
1266,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",Positive
1267,"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough.",Positive
1268,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.",Positive
1269,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",Positive

Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue.",Neutral
1272,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",Positive
1273,"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped.",Neutral

1276,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",Positive

1278,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",Positive
1279,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",Positive
1280,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",Positive

I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.",Positive

1283,"I may consider myself lucky to be alive to watch Christopher Nolan Works which get better by years.Oppenheimer is - with no doubt- going to be one of the best movies in the history. Amazing cinematography, Exceptional acting and terrifying Soundtracks.All the cast are great from cilian Murphy who is going for the oscar with this role to Rupert Downey jr and Emily blunt and finally rami malik who has small scenes but you will never forget them.I didn't watch it in Imax as i couldn't wait and ran to the nearest cinema but now i will sure book an imax ticket.Don't waste any time, book your ticket and Go watch it.. NOW.",Positive
1284,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!",Positive

1286,"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",Positive

1288,"This must be the most overrated film of the year.Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.There are far too many characters.Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",Positive
1289,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",Neutral
1290,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",Neutral
1291,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",Positive
1292,"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough.",Positive
1293,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.",Positive
1294,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",Positive

1296,"Nolan is back and delivers a fast paced thrilling biopic that will leave you stunned.the cinematography, sound design, score all exceptional. Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue.",Neutral
1297,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",Positive
1298,"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped.",Neutral
1299,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",Positive

1301,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",Positive

1303,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",Positive
1304,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",Positive
1305,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",Positive

1311,"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",Positive

1313,"This must be the most overrated film of the year.Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.There are far too many characters.Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",Positive
1314,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",Neutral
1315,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",Neutral
1316,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",Positive
1317,"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough.",Positive
1318,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.",Positive
1319,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",Positive

1321,"Nolan is back and delivers a fast paced thrilling biopic that will leave you stunned.the cinematography, sound design, score all exceptional. Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue.",Neutral
1322,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",Positive
1323,"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped.",Neutral
1324,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",Positive

1326,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",Positive

1328,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",Positive
1329,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",Positive
1330,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",Positive
1331,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine .

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!",Positive

1336,"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",Positive

1338,"This must be the most overrated film of the year.Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.There are far too many characters.Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",Positive
1339,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",Neutral
1340,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",Neutral
1341,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",Positive
1342,"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough.",Positive
1343,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.",Positive
1344,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",Positive

1346,"Nolan is back and delivers a fast paced thrilling biopic that will leave you stunned.the cinematography, sound design, score all exceptional. Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue.",Neutral
1347,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",Positive
1348,"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped.",Neutral
1349,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",Positive

1351,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",Positive

1353,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",Positive
1354,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",Positive
1355,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",Positive
1356,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine .

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!",Positive

1361,"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",Positive

1363,"This must be the most overrated film of the year.Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.There are far too many characters.Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",Positive
1364,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",Neutral
1365,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",Neutral
1366,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand.

The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",Positive
1367,"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough.",Positive
1368,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.",Positive
1369,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",Positive

1371,"Nolan is back and delivers a fast paced thrilling biopic that will leave you stunned.the cinematography, sound design, score all exceptional. Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue.",Neutral
1372,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",Positive
1373,"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped.",Neutral
1374,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",Positive

1376,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",Positive

1378,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",Positive
1379,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",Positive
1380,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",Positive
1381,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.",Positive

NOW.",Positive
1384,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!",Positive

1386,"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",Positive

1388,"This must be the most overrated film of the year.Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.There are far too many characters.Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",Positive
1389,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",Neutral
1390,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",Neutral
1391,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",Positive
1392,"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough.",Positive
1393,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.",Positive
1394,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",Positive

1397,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",Positive
1398,"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped.",Neutral

1401,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",Positive

1403,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",Positive
1404,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",Positive
1405,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",Positive
1406,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.",Positive

1409,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!",Positive

1411,"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",Positive

1413,"This must be the most overrated film of the year.Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.There are far too many characters.Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",Positive
1414,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",Neutral
1415,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",Neutral
1416,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",Positive
1417,"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough.",Positive
1418,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.",Positive
1419,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",Positive

1426,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",Positive
1429,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",Positive
1430,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",Positive
1431,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.",Positive

Amazing cinematography, Exceptional acting and terrifying Soundtracks.All the cast are great from cilian Murphy who is going for the oscar with this role to Rupert Downey jr and Emily blunt and finally rami malik who has small scenes but you will never forget them.I didn't watch it in Imax as i couldn't wait and ran to the nearest cinema but now i will sure book an imax ticket.Don't waste any time, book your ticket and Go watch it.. NOW.",Positive
1434,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!",Positive

1436,"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",Positive

1438,"This must be the most overrated film of the year.Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.There are far too many characters.Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",Positive
1439,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",Neutral
1440,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",Neutral
1441,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",Positive
1442,"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough.",Positive
1443,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.",Positive
1444,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",Positive

Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue.",Neutral
1447,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",Positive
1448,"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped.",Neutral

1451,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",Positive

I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",Positive

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",Positive
1455,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",Positive
1456,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.",Positive

1458,"I may consider myself lucky to be alive to watch Christopher Nolan Works which get better by years.Oppenheimer is - with no doubt- going to be one of the best movies in the history. Amazing cinematography, Exceptional acting and terrifying Soundtracks.All the cast are great from cilian Murphy who is going for the oscar with this role to Rupert Downey jr and Emily blunt and finally rami malik who has small scenes but you will never forget them.I didn't watch it in Imax as i couldn't wait and ran to the nearest cinema but now i will sure book an imax ticket.Don't waste any time, book your ticket and Go watch it.. NOW.",Positive
1459,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!",Positive

1461,"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",Positive

1463,"This must be the most overrated film of the year.Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.There are far too many characters.Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",Positive
1464,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",Neutral
1465,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",Neutral
1466,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",Positive
1467,"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough.",Positive
1468,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.",Positive
1469,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",Positive

Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue.",Neutral
1472,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",Positive
1473,"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped.",Neutral
1474,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",Positive

1476,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",Positive

1478,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",Positive
1479,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",Positive
1480,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",Positive
1481,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.",Positive

1483,"I may consider myself lucky to be alive to watch Christopher Nolan Works which get better by years.Oppenheimer is - with no doubt- going to be one of the best movies in the history. Amazing cinematography, Exceptional acting and terrifying Soundtracks.All the cast are great from cilian Murphy who is going for the oscar with this role to Rupert Downey jr and Emily blunt and finally rami malik who has small scenes but you will never forget them.I didn't watch it in Imax as i couldn't wait and ran to the nearest cinema but now i will sure book an imax ticket.Don't waste any time, book your ticket and Go watch it.. NOW.",Positive
1484,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!",Positive

1486,"After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.Anyone who has read the book ""American Prometheus"" on which the film is based, can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film in particular is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. I'm actually visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film - and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",Positive

1488,"This must be the most overrated film of the year.Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.There are far too many characters.Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote.",Positive
1489,"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",Neutral
1490,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",Neutral
1491,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",Positive
1492,"Oppenheimer is one of the most emotionally intense movies I have seen in a long time. The themes of how far one should go both in the name of science and ending a war, as well as the morality of when/if the bomb should be used leaves one shaken and prone to discussing it for a long time afterwards. The non-linear narrative structure is one of director Christopher Nolan's signature techniques, and here, it presents the story in a way that keeps you guessing and even has some surprises in store (as long as you don't know too much about the real life events). The film's well paced given its length, and as for the dialogue, there's plenty to be said for a film that takes a subject that most don't know much about, like quantum mechanics, and successfully explains it without dumbing it down. A fair amount of quotable lines helps too.Cillian Murphy is an immensely talented actor who easily earned his Oscar win for this performance, effectively portraying Oppenheimer's intelligence and arrogance while also giving us the film's emotional center. Equally exceptional and deserving of his Oscar is Robert Downey Jr, for whom this is a massive career saver after the disastrous Dolittle. And the rest of the cast is great too, as are the characters they play. The first time I watched this, I remember being puzzled seeing Rami Malek in a role that seemed silent, but rest assured that he gets his big scene later.It never ceases to astonish me that no CGI was used here, given some of the extensive visual effects, many of which showcase Oppenheimer's thoughts and state of mind. I also give the script credit for actually explaining what the imagery is supposed to represent; it's not just trippy visuals for the sake of it. The most stunning is the explosion during the Trinity test; it still gives me chills whenever I watch the film. Meanwhile, the sound design is absolutely jaw dropping. The part that really stands out is, whenever there's an explosion outside of Oppenheimer's mind, the sound is delayed a few seconds like it's supposed to be, not how it's always portrayed in other films. Couple that with a powerful, intense musical score, and you're left on the edge of your seat in more ways than one.Overall, Oppenheimer is another slam dunk from one of my all time favorite directors. It's an emotional and dramatic powerhouse that grabs you from the get go and never releases till the end. It's easily my favorite film from last year and I can't recommend it enough.",Positive
1493,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.",Positive
1494,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",Positive

1496,"Nolan is back and delivers a fast paced thrilling biopic that will leave you stunned.the cinematography, sound design, score all exceptional. Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue.",Neutral
1497,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",Positive
1498,"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped.",Neutral
1499,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",Positive
